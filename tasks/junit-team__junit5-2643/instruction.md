JUnit Jupiter is missing an assertion for verifying that an executable throws an exception of an exact type (not a subtype and not a supertype). Add a new assertion method `Assertions.assertThrowsExactly(Class<T> expectedType, Executable executable)` (and corresponding overloads consistent with existing `assertThrows` APIs, such as versions accepting a failure message / message supplier) that behaves like `assertThrows` but requires the thrown exception’s runtime class to be exactly `expectedType`.

When `assertThrowsExactly` is invoked and the executable throws an exception whose type is not exactly the expected type, the assertion must fail with an `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError` whose message begins with `Unexpected exception type thrown ==> ` and includes both the expected and actual types in the form `expected: <...>` and `but was: <...>`. This failure must occur both when the executable throws a parent/supertype of the expected type and when it throws a child/subtype of the expected type.

When the executable throws an exception of exactly the expected type, `assertThrowsExactly` must return that exception instance (non-null) so callers can further inspect it (for example, asserting on an `ExecutionException`’s cause message). The assertion must work when the executable is provided as a lambda or a method reference, including method references that return a value (i.e., non-void methods).

Also ensure precondition checks match existing Jupiter assertion conventions: `expectedType` must not be null and `executable` must not be null, and failures should be reported consistently with other assertions. Public API must have appropriate Javadoc and API annotations consistent with the surrounding `Assertions` methods.
