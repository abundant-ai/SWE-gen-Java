JUnit Jupiter’s default display name formatting for test methods includes an empty pair of parentheses for methods with no parameters (e.g., `assigned()`), which is undesirable for languages like Kotlin where backticked method names are often used as human-readable phrases. For example, a nested class containing methods named ``fun `failure -- stop`() {}`` and ``fun assigned() {}`` currently produces display names like `failure -- stop()` and `assigned()`, but the expected display names are `failure -- stop` and `assigned` (no trailing `()` when there are no parameters).

Introduce a new `DisplayNameGenerator` implementation named `DisplayNameGenerator.Simple`. It should behave like `DisplayNameGenerator.Standard` for class and method name generation in general, but with one key difference for method display names: if a generated method display name would end with empty parentheses (i.e., the method has no parameters and the name would normally be rendered as `methodName()`), the `Simple` generator must remove those empty parentheses. If a method has parameters, the parameter list must still be shown, and formatting must remain consistent (e.g., `test (TestInfo)` and `testUsingCamelCase_and_also_UnderScores_keepingParameterTypeNamesIntact (TestInfo)` should retain the parenthesized parameter type, including any spacing conventions required by the generator).

`@DisplayName` must continue to take precedence over any generator, so if a method is annotated with `@DisplayName`, that exact display name should be used regardless of the generator.

When a test class is annotated with `@DisplayNameGeneration(DisplayNameGenerator.Simple.class)`, the generated display names for test methods should follow these rules:

- Zero-parameter method `test()` should display as `test`.
- One-parameter method such as `test(TestInfo)` should display with the parameter type preserved (e.g., `test (TestInfo)`), not stripped.
- Methods with camelCase or underscores should not be transformed beyond the removal of empty parentheses; for example, `testUsingCamelCaseStyle()` should display as `testUsingCamelCaseStyle`, and `test_with_underscores()` should display as `test_with_underscores`.

Implement `DisplayNameGenerator.Simple` and ensure it integrates with the existing `@DisplayNameGeneration` mechanism so that selecting `Simple` results in the expected display name output across containers and tests.
