A performance regression was introduced when Ktor client uses `ContentEncoding` together with `HttpRequestRetry` (and responses may be buffered/saved via the response-body saving mechanism). In this setup, retries can leave response body pipelines running even though the retry logic only needs to inspect a tiny part of the body.

Reproduction scenario: configure a client with `install(ContentEncoding)` and `install(HttpRequestRetry)`, make a request that fails and triggers retries (for example, repeated 5xx responses). Internally, the retry plugin calls `HttpResponse.rawContent`, reads only a small portion (as little as a single byte) to decide about retry, and then proceeds to retry without consuming the full body. Because the content is saved/buffered, each call to `rawContent` may create a fresh channel; `ContentEncoding` starts a coroutine to decode each channel and that coroutine remains active until the body is fully read or the channel is closed/cancelled.

Actual behavior: the decoding coroutine spawned by `ContentEncoding` can remain suspended waiting for the rest of the body, and since the retry path doesn’t fully consume the body, the coroutine can hang until the request times out (default timeout around 15 seconds). This leads to severe performance degradation and unnecessary coroutine/resource accumulation during retries.

Expected behavior: when `HttpRequestRetry` inspects `HttpResponse.rawContent` but does not intend to read the whole body (e.g., it reads only a small prefix), it must ensure the raw content channel is properly cancelled/closed so that any upstream processing (including `ContentEncoding` decoding coroutines) is terminated promptly. Additionally, response cleanup must not trigger extra `rawContent` access/creation for responses whose body has already been saved/buffered; cleanup should not create new raw channels for saved responses.

Implement fixes so that:
1) The retry mechanism cancels the `rawContent` channel after it has read what it needs, preventing hanging `ContentEncoding` coroutines.
2) Response cleanup logic does not call `rawContent` in a way that creates new channels/coroutines for already-saved responses.

The behavior should be verifiable by making a request with retries enabled and ensuring retries happen without long delays/timeouts and without leaving background decoding coroutines running after each retry decision.
