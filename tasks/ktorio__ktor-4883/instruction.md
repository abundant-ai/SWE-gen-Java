HTMX support in Ktor exposes APIs that are intended to be experimental, but the experimental marker is currently defined in an HTMX-specific way that makes it hard to reuse consistently across other Ktor APIs. Because the marker type is tied to HTMX, it also cannot be safely removed or repurposed later without breaking binary/source compatibility.

Unify the experimental annotation used by HTMX so that HTMX APIs opt into a common Ktor experimental marker, rather than a bespoke HTMX-only experimental flag. After this change, any HTMX-facing API that requires opt-in must be annotated with the common experimental annotation, and callers must be able to opt in via `@OptIn(ExperimentalKtorApi::class)`.

Concretely, these scenarios must work:

- Building HTML with HTMX attributes via `attributes.hx { ... }` must compile and behave correctly under `@OptIn(ExperimentalKtorApi::class)`. For example, setting `get`, `target`, `swap = HxSwap.outerHtml`, and `trigger` must result in the corresponding `hx-*` attributes being rendered (e.g., `hx-get`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap="outerHTML"`, `hx-trigger`).

- Server routing using the HTMX routing DSL must compile and behave correctly under `@OptIn(ExperimentalKtorApi::class)`. In a routing tree like `route("htmx") { ...; hx.get { ... }; hx { target("#test") { get { ... } }; trigger("#button") { get { ... } } } }`, requests without HTMX headers must continue to hit the normal `get { ... }` handler, while requests with `HxRequestHeaders.Request = "true"` must be routed through the `hx` handlers. Additionally, when `HxRequestHeaders.Target` or `HxRequestHeaders.Trigger` headers are present, the corresponding nested `target(...)` / `trigger(...)` routes must be selected.

Currently, after moving/standardizing the experimental marker, these APIs either still reference the old HTMX-specific experimental annotation or no longer correctly require/accept opt-in, leading to compilation issues (missing or mismatched opt-in annotations) and inconsistent experimental API marking. Update the HTMX APIs so they consistently use the shared experimental annotation type and the opt-in mechanism is uniform across both the HTML attribute DSL and the server routing DSL.
