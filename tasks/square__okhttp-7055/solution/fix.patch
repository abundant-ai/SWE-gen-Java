+Caching
+=======
+
+OkHttp implements an optional, off by default, Cache. OkHttp aims for RFC correct and
+pragmatic caching behaviour, following common real-world browser like Firefox/Chrome and 
+server behaviour when ambiguous.
+
+# Basic Usage
+
+```kotlin
+  private val client: OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
+      .cache(Cache(
+          directory = File(application.cacheDir, "http_cache"),
+          // $0.05 worth of phone storage in 2020
+          maxSize = 50L * 1024L * 1024L // 50 MiB
+      ))
+      .build()
+```
+
+## EventListener events 
+
+Cache Events are exposed via the EventListener API.  Typical scenarios are below.
+
+### Cache Hit
+
+In the ideal scenario the cache can fulfill the request without any conditional call to the network.
+This will skip the normal events such as DNS, connecting to the network, and downloading the response body.
+
+As recommended by the HTTP RFC the max age of a document is defaulted to 10% of the 
+document's age at the time it was served based on "Last-Modified". Default expiration dates aren't used for URIs 
+containing a query.
+
+ - CallStart
+ - **CacheHit**
+ - CallEnd
+ 
+### Cache Miss
+
+Under a cache miss the normal request events are seen but an additional event shows the presence of the cache.
+Cache Miss will be typical if the item has not been read from the network, is uncacheable, or is past it's 
+lifetime based on Response cache headers.
+
+ - CallStart 
+ - **CacheMiss**
+ - ProxySelectStart
+ - ... Standard Events ...
+ - CallEnd
+        
+### Conditional Cache Hit
+ 
+When cache flags require checking the cache results are still valid an early cacheConditionalHit event is
+received followed by a cache hit or miss.  Critically in the cache hit scenario the server won’t send the response body.
+
+The response will have non-null `cacheResponse` and `networkResponse`. The cacheResponse will be used as the top level
+response only if the response code is HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified.
+ 
+ - CallStart
+ - **CacheConditionalHit**
+ - ConnectionAcquired
+ - ... Standard Events...
+ - ResponseBodyEnd _(0 bytes)_
+ - **CacheHit**
+ - ConnectionReleased
+ - CallEnd
+ 
+## Cache directory
+
+The cache directory must be exclusively owned by a single instance.
+
+Deleting the cache when it is no longer needed can be done.  However this may delete the purpose of the cache
+which is designed to persist between app restarts.
+
+```
+cache.delete()
+```
+ 
+## Pruning the Cache
+
+Pruning the entire Cache to clear space temporarily can be done using evictAll.
+
+```
+cache.evictAll()
+```
+
+Removing individual items can be done using the urls iterator.
+This would be typical after a user initiates a force refresh by a pull to refresh type action.
+
+```
+    val urlIterator = cache.urls()
+    while (urlIterator.hasNext()) {
+      if (urlIterator.next().startsWith("https://www.google.com/")) {
+        urlIterator.remove()
+      }
+    }
+```
+
+### Troubleshooting
+
+1. Valid cacheable responses are not being cached
+
+Make sure you are reading responses fully as unless they are read fully, cancelled or stalled Responses will not be cached.
+
+### Overriding normal cache behaviour
+
+See Cache documentation. https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-cache/

+# Calls
+
+The HTTP client’s job is to accept your request and produce its response. This is simple in theory but it gets tricky in practice.
+
+## [Requests](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-request/)
+
+Each HTTP request contains a URL, a method (like `GET` or `POST`), and a list of headers. Requests may also contain a body: a data stream of a specific content type.
+
+## [Responses](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-response/)
+
+The response answers the request with a code (like 200 for success or 404 for not found), headers, and its own optional body.
+
+## Rewriting Requests
+
+When you provide OkHttp with an HTTP request, you’re describing the request at a high-level: _“fetch me this URL with these headers.”_ For correctness and efficiency, OkHttp rewrites your request before transmitting it.
+
+OkHttp may add headers that are absent from the original request, including `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `User-Agent`, `Host`, `Connection`, and `Content-Type`. It will add an `Accept-Encoding` header for transparent response compression unless the header is already present. If you’ve got cookies, OkHttp will add a `Cookie` header with them.
+
+Some requests will have a cached response. When this cached response isn’t fresh, OkHttp can do a _conditional GET_ to download an updated response if it’s newer than what’s cached. This requires headers like `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` to be added.
+
+## Rewriting Responses
+
+If transparent compression was used, OkHttp will drop the corresponding response headers `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` because they don’t apply to the decompressed response body.
+
+If a conditional GET was successful, responses from the network and cache are merged as directed by the spec.
+
+## Follow-up Requests
+
+When your requested URL has moved, the webserver will return a response code like `302` to indicate the document’s new URL. OkHttp will follow the redirect to retrieve a final response.
+
+If the response issues an authorization challenge, OkHttp will ask the [`Authenticator`](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-authenticator/) (if one is configured) to satisfy the challenge. If the authenticator supplies a credential, the request is retried with that credential included.
+
+## Retrying Requests
+
+Sometimes connections fail: either a pooled connection was stale and disconnected, or the webserver itself couldn’t be reached. OkHttp will retry the request with a different route if one is available.
+
+## [Calls](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-call/)
+
+With rewrites, redirects, follow-ups and retries, your simple request may yield many requests and responses. OkHttp uses `Call` to model the task of satisfying your request through however many intermediate requests and responses are necessary. Typically this isn’t many! But it’s comforting to know that your code will continue to work if your URLs are redirected or if you failover to an alternate IP address.
+
+Calls are executed in one of two ways:
+
+ * **Synchronous:** your thread blocks until the response is readable.
+ * **Asynchronous:** you enqueue the request on any thread, and get [called back](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-callback/) on another thread when the response is readable.
+
+Calls can be canceled from any thread. This will fail the call if it hasn’t yet completed! Code that is writing the request body or reading the response body will suffer an `IOException` when its call is canceled.
+
+## Dispatch
+
+For synchronous calls, you bring your own thread and are responsible for managing how many simultaneous requests you make. Too many simultaneous connections wastes resources; too few harms latency.
+
+For asynchronous calls, [`Dispatcher`](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-dispatcher/) implements policy for maximum simultaneous requests. You can set maximums per-webserver (default is 5), and overall (default is 64).

+OkHttp 1.x Change Log
+=====================
+
+## Version 1.6.0
+
+_2014-05-23_
+
+ * Offer bridges to make it easier to migrate from OkHttp 1.x to OkHttp 2.0.
+   This adds `OkUrlFactory`, `Cache`, and `@Deprecated` annotations for APIs
+   dropped in 2.0.
+
+## Version 1.5.4
+
+_2014-04-14_
+
+ * Drop ALPN support in Android. There's a concurrency bug in all
+   currently-shipping versions.
+ * Support asynchronous disconnects by breaking the socket only. This should
+   prevent flakiness from multiple threads concurrently accessing a stream.
+
+## Version 1.5.3
+
+_2014-03-29_
+
+ * Fix bug where the Content-Length header was not always dropped when
+   following a redirect from a POST to a GET.
+ * Implement basic support for `Thread.interrupt()`. OkHttp now checks
+   for an interruption before doing a blocking call. If it is interrupted,
+   it throws an `InterruptedIOException`.
+
+## Version 1.5.2
+
+_2014-03-17_
+
+ * Fix bug where deleting a file that was absent from the `HttpResponseCache`
+   caused an IOException.
+ * Fix bug in HTTP/2 where our HPACK decoder wasn't emitting entries in
+   certain eviction scenarios, leading to dropped response headers.
+
+## Version 1.5.1
+
+_2014-03-11_
+
+ * Fix 1.5.0 regression where connections should not have been recycled.
+ * Fix 1.5.0 regression where transparent Gzip was broken by attempting to
+   recover from another I/O failure.
+ * Fix problems where spdy/3.1 headers may not have been compressed properly.
+ * Fix problems with spdy/3.1 and http/2 where the wrong window size was being
+   used.
+ * Fix 1.5.0 regression where conditional cache responses could corrupt the
+   connection pool.
+
+
+## Version 1.5.0
+
+_2014-03-07_
+
+
+##### OkHttp no longer uses the default SSL context.
+
+Applications that want to use the global SSL context with OkHttp should configure their
+OkHttpClient instances with the following:
+
+```java
+okHttpClient.setSslSocketFactory(HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSSLSocketFactory());
+```
+
+A simpler solution is to avoid the shared default SSL socket factory. Instead, if you
+need to customize SSL, do so for your specific OkHttpClient instance only.
+
+##### Synthetic headers have changed
+
+Previously OkHttp added a synthetic response header, `OkHttp-Selected-Transport`. It
+has been replaced with a new synthetic header, `OkHttp-Selected-Protocol`.
+
+##### Changes
+
+ * New: Support for `HTTP-draft-09/2.0`.
+ * New: Support for `spdy/3.1`. Dropped support for `spdy/3`.
+ * New: Use ALPN on Android platforms that support it (4.4+)
+ * New: CacheControl model and parser.
+ * New: Protocol selection in MockWebServer.
+ * Fix: Route selection shouldn't use TLS modes that we know will fail.
+ * Fix: Cache SPDY responses even if the response body is closed prematurely.
+ * Fix: Use strict timeouts when aborting a download.
+ * Fix: Support Shoutcast HTTP responses like `ICY 200 OK`.
+ * Fix: Don't unzip if there isn't a response body.
+ * Fix: Don't leak gzip streams on redirects.
+ * Fix: Don't do DNS lookups on invalid hosts.
+ * Fix: Exhaust the underlying stream when reading gzip streams.
+ * Fix: Support the `PATCH` method.
+ * Fix: Support request bodies on `DELETE` method.
+ * Fix: Drop the `okhttp-protocols` module.
+ * Internal: Replaced internal byte array buffers with pooled buffers ("OkBuffer").
+
+
+## Version 1.3.0
+
+_2014-01-11_
+
+ * New: Support for "PATCH" HTTP method in client and MockWebServer.
+ * Fix: Drop `Content-Length` header when redirected from POST to GET.
+ * Fix: Correctly read cached header entries with malformed header names.
+ * Fix: Do not directly support any authentication schemes other than "Basic".
+ * Fix: Respect read timeouts on recycled connections.
+ * Fix: Transmit multiple cookie values as a single header with delimiter.
+ * Fix: Ensure `null` is never returned from a connection's `getHeaderFields()`.
+ * Fix: Persist proper `Content-Encoding` header to cache for GZip responses.
+ * Fix: Eliminate rare race condition in SPDY streams that would prevent connection reuse.
+ * Fix: Change HTTP date formats to UTC to conform to RFC2616 section 3.3.
+ * Fix: Support SPDY header blocks with trailing bytes.
+ * Fix: Allow `;` as separator for `Cache-Control` header.
+ * Fix: Correct bug where HTTPS POST requests were always automatically buffered.
+ * Fix: Honor read timeout when parsing SPDY headers.
+
+
+## Version 1.2.1
+
+_2013-08-23_
+
+ * Resolve issue with 'jar-with-dependencies' artifact creation.
+ * Fix: Support empty SPDY header values.
+
+
+## Version 1.2.0
+
+_2013-08-11_
+
+ *  New APIs on OkHttpClient to set default timeouts for connect and read.
+ *  Fix bug when caching SPDY responses.
+ *  Fix a bug with SPDY plus half-closed streams. (thanks kwuollett)
+ *  Fix a bug in `Content-Length` reporting for gzipped streams in the Apache
+    HTTP client adapter. (thanks kwuollett)
+ *  Work around the Alcatel `getByInetAddress` bug (thanks k.kocel)
+ *  Be more aggressive about testing pooled sockets before reuse. (thanks
+    warpspin)
+ *  Include `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding` in the Apache HTTP client
+    adapter. (thanks kwuollett)
+ *  Add a media type class to OkHttp.
+ *  Change custom header prefix:
+
+    ```
+    X-Android-Sent-Millis is now OkHttp-Sent-Millis
+    X-Android-Received-Millis is now OkHttp-Received-Millis
+    X-Android-Response-Source is now OkHttp-Response-Source
+    X-Android-Selected-Transport is now OkHttp-Selected-Transport
+    ```
+ *  Improve cache invalidation for POST-like requests.
+ *  Bring MockWebServer into OkHttp and teach it SPDY.
+
+
+## Version 1.1.1
+
+_2013-06-23_
+
+ * Fix: ClassCastException when caching responses that were redirected from
+   HTTP to HTTPS.
+
+
+## Version 1.1.0
+
+_2013-06-15_
+
+ * Fix: Connection reuse was broken for most HTTPS connections due to a bug in
+   the way the hostname verifier was selected.
+ * Fix: Locking bug in SpdyConnection.
+ * Fix: Ignore null header values (for compatibility with HttpURLConnection).
+ * Add URLStreamHandlerFactory support so that `URL.openConnection()` uses
+   OkHttp.
+ * Expose the transport ("http/1.1", "spdy/3", etc.) via magic request headers.
+   Use `X-Android-Transports` to write the preferred transports and
+   `X-Android-Selected-Transport` to read the negotiated transport.
+
+
+## Version 1.0.2
+
+_2013-05-11_
+
+ * Fix: Remove use of Java 6-only APIs.
+ * Fix: Properly handle exceptions from `NetworkInterface` when querying MTU.
+ * Fix: Ensure MTU has a reasonable default and upper-bound.
+
+
+## Version 1.0.1
+
+_2013-05-06_
+
+ * Correct casing of SSL in method names (`getSslSocketFactory`/`setSslSocketFactory`).
+
+
+## Version 1.0.0
+
+_2013-05-06_
+
+Initial release.

+OkHttp 2.x Change Log
+=====================
+
+## Version 2.7.5
+
+_2016-02-25_
+
+ *  Fix: Change the certificate pinner to always build full chains. This
+    prevents a potential crash when using certificate pinning with the Google
+    Play Services security provider.
+
+
+## Version 2.7.4
+
+_2016-02-07_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when finding the trust manager if the Play Services (GMS)
+    security provider is installed.
+ *  Fix: The previous release introduced a performance regression on Android,
+    caused by looking up CA certificates. This is now fixed.
+
+
+## Version 2.7.3
+
+_2016-02-06_
+
+ *  Fix: Permit the trusted CA root to be pinned by `CertificatePinner`.
+
+
+## Version 2.7.2
+
+_2016-01-07_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't eagerly release stream allocations on cache hits. We might still
+    need them to handle redirects.
+
+
+## Version 2.7.1
+
+_2016-01-01_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't do a health check on newly-created connections. This is
+    unnecessary work that could put the client in an inconsistent state if the
+    health check fails.
+
+
+## Version 2.7.0
+
+_2015-12-13_
+
+ *  **Rewritten connection management.** Previously OkHttp's connection pool
+    managed both idle and active connections for HTTP/2, but only idle
+    connections for HTTP/1.x. With this update the connection pool manages both
+    idle and active connections for everything. OkHttp now detects and warns on
+    connections that were allocated but never released, and will enforce HTTP/2
+    stream limits. This update also fixes `Call.cancel()` to not do I/O on the
+    calling thread.
+ *  Fix: Don't log gzipped data in the logging interceptor.
+ *  Fix: Don't resolve DNS addresses when connecting through a SOCKS proxy.
+ *  Fix: Drop the synthetic `OkHttp-Selected-Protocol` response header.
+ *  Fix: Support 204 and 205 'No Content' replies in the logging interceptor.
+ *  New: Add `Call.isExecuted()`.
+
+
+## Version 2.6.0
+
+_2015-11-22_
+
+ *  **New Logging Interceptor.** The `logging-interceptor` subproject offers
+    simple request and response logging. It may be configured to log headers and
+    bodies for debugging. It requires this Maven dependency:
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>

+
+    Configure basic logging like this:
+
+    ```java
+    HttpLoggingInterceptor loggingInterceptor = new HttpLoggingInterceptor();
+    loggingInterceptor.setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BASIC);
+    client.networkInterceptors().add(loggingInterceptor);
+    ```
+
+    **Warning:** Avoid `Level.HEADERS` and `Level.BODY` in production because
+    they could leak passwords and other authentication credentials to insecure
+    logs.
+
+ *  **WebSocket API now uses `RequestBody` and `ResponseBody` for messages.**
+    This is a backwards-incompatible API change.
+
+ *  **The DNS service is now pluggable.** In some situations this may be useful
+    to manually prioritize specific IP addresses.
+
+ *  Fix: Don't throw when converting an `HttpUrl` to a `java.net.URI`.
+    Previously URLs with special characters like `|` and `[` would break when
+    subjected to URI’s overly-strict validation.
+ *  Fix: Don't re-encode `+` as `%20` in encoded URL query strings. OkHttp
+    prefers `%20` when doing its own encoding, but will retain `+` when that is
+    provided.
+ *  Fix: Enforce that callers call `WebSocket.close()` on IO errors. Error
+    handling in WebSockets is significantly improved.
+ *  Fix: Don't use SPDY/3 style header concatenation for HTTP/2 request headers.
+    This could have corrupted requests where multiple headers had the same name,
+    as in cookies.
+ *  Fix: Reject bad characters in the URL hostname. Previously characters like
+    `\0` would cause a late crash when building the request.
+ *  Fix: Allow interceptors to change the request method.
+ *  Fix: Don’t use the request's `User-Agent` or `Proxy-Authorization` when
+    connecting to an HTTPS server via an HTTP tunnel. The `Proxy-Authorization`
+    header was being leaked to the origin server.
+ *  Fix: Digits may be used in a URL scheme.
+ *  Fix: Improve connection timeout recovery.
+ *  Fix: Recover from `getsockname` crashes impacting Android releases prior to
+    4.2.2.
+ *  Fix: Drop partial support for HTTP/1.0. Previously OkHttp would send
+    `HTTP/1.0` on connections after seeing a response with `HTTP/1.0`. The fixed
+    behavior is consistent with Firefox and Chrome.
+ *  Fix: Allow a body in `OPTIONS` requests.
+ *  Fix: Don't percent-encode non-ASCII characters in URL fragments.
+ *  Fix: Handle null fragments.
+ *  Fix: Don’t crash on interceptors that throw `IOException` before a
+    connection is attempted.
+ *  New: Support [WebDAV][webdav] HTTP methods.
+ *  New: Buffer WebSocket frames for better performance.
+ *  New: Drop support for `TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`, our only remaining
+    DSS cipher suite. This is consistent with Firefox and Chrome which have also
+    dropped these cipher suite.
+
+## Version 2.5.0
+
+_2015-08-25_
+
+ *  **Timeouts now default to 10 seconds.** Previously we defaulted to never
+    timing out, and that was a lousy policy. If establishing a connection,
+    reading the next byte from a connection, or writing the next byte to a
+    connection takes more than 10 seconds to complete, you’ll need to adjust
+    the timeouts manually.
+
+ *  **OkHttp now rejects request headers that contain invalid characters.** This
+    includes potential security problems (newline characters) as well as simple
+    non-ASCII characters (including international characters and emoji).
+
+ *  **Call canceling is more reliable.**  We had a bug where a socket being
+     connected wasn't being closed when the application used `Call.cancel()`.
+
+ *  **Changing a HttpUrl’s scheme now tracks the default port.** We had a bug
+    where changing a URL from `http` to `https` would leave it on port 80.
+
+ *  **Okio has been updated to 1.6.0.**
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.6.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+     ```
+
+ *  New: `Cache.initialize()`. Call this on a background thread to eagerly
+    initialize the response cache.
+ *  New: Fold `MockWebServerRule` into `MockWebServer`. This makes it easier to
+    write JUnit tests with `MockWebServer`. The `MockWebServer` library now
+    depends on JUnit, though it continues to work with all testing frameworks.
+ *  Fix: `FormEncodingBuilder` is now consistent with browsers in which
+    characters it escapes. Previously we weren’t percent-encoding commas,
+    parens, and other characters.
+ *  Fix: Relax `FormEncodingBuilder` to support building empty forms.
+ *  Fix: Timeouts throw `SocketTimeoutException`, not `InterruptedIOException`.
+ *  Fix: Change `MockWebServer` to use the same logic as OkHttp when determining
+    whether an HTTP request permits a body.
+ *  Fix: `HttpUrl` now uses the canonical form for IPv6 addresses.
+ *  Fix: Use `HttpUrl` internally.
+ *  Fix: Recover from Android 4.2.2 EBADF crashes.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash with an `IllegalStateException` if an HTTP/2 or SPDY
+    write fails, leaving the connection in an inconsistent state.
+ *  Fix: Make sure the default user agent is ASCII.
+
+
+## Version 2.4.0
+
+_2015-05-22_
+
+ *  **Forbid response bodies on HTTP 204 and 205 responses.** Webservers that
+    return such malformed responses will now trigger a `ProtocolException` in
+    the client.
+
+ *  **WebSocketListener has incompatible changes.** The `onOpen()` method is now
+    called on the reader thread, so implementations must return before further
+    websocket messages will be delivered. The `onFailure()` method now includes
+    an HTTP response if one was returned.
+
+## Version 2.4.0-RC1
+
+_2015-05-16_
+
+ *  **New HttpUrl API.** It's like `java.net.URL` but good. Note that
+    `Request.Builder.url()` now throws `IllegalArgumentException` on malformed
+    URLs. (Previous releases would throw a `MalformedURLException` when calling
+    a malformed URL.)
+
+ *  **We've improved connect failure recovery.** We now differentiate between
+    setup, connecting, and connected and implement appropriate recovery rules
+    for each. This changes `Address` to no longer use `ConnectionSpec`. (This is
+    an incompatible API change).
+
+ *  **`FormEncodingBuilder` now uses `%20` instead of `+` for encoded spaces.**
+    Both are permitted-by-spec, but `%20` requires fewer special cases.
+
+ *  **Okio has been updated to 1.4.0.**
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.4.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+     ```
+
+ *  **`Request.Builder` no longer accepts null if a request body is required.**
+    Passing null will now fail for request methods that require a body. Instead
+    use an empty body such as this one:
+
+    ```java
+        RequestBody.create(null, new byte[0]);
+    ```
+
+ * **`CertificatePinner` now supports wildcard hostnames.** As always with
+   certificate pinning, you must be very careful to avoid [bricking][brick]
+   your app. You'll need to pin both the top-level domain and the `*.` domain
+   for full coverage.
+
+    ```java
+     client.setCertificatePinner(new CertificatePinner.Builder()
+         .add("publicobject.com",   "sha1/DmxUShsZuNiqPQsX2Oi9uv2sCnw=")
+         .add("*.publicobject.com", "sha1/DmxUShsZuNiqPQsX2Oi9uv2sCnw=")
+         .add("publicobject.com",   "sha1/SXxoaOSEzPC6BgGmxAt/EAcsajw=")
+         .add("*.publicobject.com", "sha1/SXxoaOSEzPC6BgGmxAt/EAcsajw=")
+         .add("publicobject.com",   "sha1/blhOM3W9V/bVQhsWAcLYwPU6n24=")
+         .add("*.publicobject.com", "sha1/blhOM3W9V/bVQhsWAcLYwPU6n24=")
+         .add("publicobject.com",   "sha1/T5x9IXmcrQ7YuQxXnxoCmeeQ84c=")
+         .add("*.publicobject.com", "sha1/T5x9IXmcrQ7YuQxXnxoCmeeQ84c=")
+         .build());
+    ```
+
+ *  **Interceptors lists are now deep-copied by `OkHttpClient.clone()`.**
+    Previously clones shared interceptors, which made it difficult to customize
+    the interceptors on a request-by-request basis.
+
+ *  New: `Headers.toMultimap()`.
+ *  New: `RequestBody.create(MediaType, ByteString)`.
+ *  New: `ConnectionSpec.isCompatible(SSLSocket)`.
+ *  New: `Dispatcher.getQueuedCallCount()` and
+    `Dispatcher.getRunningCallCount()`. These can be useful in diagnostics.
+ *  Fix: OkHttp no longer shares timeouts between pooled connections. This was
+    causing some applications to crash when connections were reused.
+ *  Fix: `OkApacheClient` now allows an empty `PUT` and `POST`.
+ *  Fix: Websockets no longer rebuffer socket streams.
+ *  Fix: Websockets are now better at handling close frames.
+ *  Fix: Content type matching is now case insensitive.
+ *  Fix: `Vary` headers are not lost with `android.net.http.HttpResponseCache`.
+ *  Fix: HTTP/2 wasn't enforcing stream timeouts when writing the underlying
+    connection. Now it is.
+ *  Fix: Never return null on `call.proceed()`. This was a bug in call
+    cancelation.
+ *  Fix: When a network interceptor mutates a request, that change is now
+    reflected in `Response.networkResponse()`.
+ *  Fix: Badly-behaving caches now throw a checked exception instead of a
+    `NullPointerException`.
+ *  Fix: Better handling of uncaught exceptions in MockWebServer with HTTP/2.
+
+## Version 2.3.0
+
+_2015-03-16_
+
+ *  **HTTP/2 support.** We've done interop testing and haven't seen any
+    problems. HTTP/2 support has been a big effort and we're particularly
+    thankful to Adrian Cole who has helped us to reach this milestone.
+
+ *  **RC4 cipher suites are no longer supported by default.** To connect to
+    old, obsolete servers relying on these cipher suites, you must create a
+    custom `ConnectionSpec`.
+
+ *  **Beta WebSockets support.**. The `okhttp-ws` subproject offers a new
+    websockets client. Please try it out! When it's ready we intend to include
+    it with the core OkHttp library.
+
+ *  **Okio updated to 1.3.0.**
+
+    ```xml
+    <dependency>
+      <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+      <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+      <version>1.3.0</version>
+    </dependency>
+    ```
+
+ *  **Fix: improve parallelism of async requests.** OkHttp's Dispatcher had a
+    misconfigured `ExecutorService` that limited the number of worker threads.
+    If you're using `Call.enqueue()` this update should significantly improve
+    request concurrency.
+
+ *  **Fix: Lazily initialize the response cache.** This avoids strict mode
+    warnings when initializing OkHttp on Android‘s main thread.
+
+ *  **Fix: Disable ALPN on Android 4.4.** That release of the feature was
+    unstable and prone to native crashes in the underlying OpenSSL code.
+ *  Fix: Don't send both `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` cache headers
+    when both are applicable.
+ *  Fix: Fail early when a port is out of range.
+ *  Fix: Offer `Content-Length` headers for multipart request bodies.
+ *  Fix: Throw `UnknownServiceException` if a cleartext connection is attempted
+    when explicitly forbidden.
+ *  Fix: Throw a `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` when host verification fails.
+ *  Fix: MockWebServer explicitly closes sockets. (On some Android releases,
+    closing the input stream and output stream of a socket is not sufficient.
+ *  Fix: Buffer outgoing HTTP/2 frames to limit how many outgoing frames are
+    created.
+ *  Fix: Avoid crashing when cache writing fails due to a full disk.
+ *  Fix: Improve caching of private responses.
+ *  Fix: Update cache-by-default response codes.
+ *  Fix: Reused `Request.Builder` instances no longer hold stale URL fields.
+ *  New: ConnectionSpec can now be configured to use the SSL socket's default
+    cipher suites. To use, set the cipher suites to `null`.
+ *  New: Support `DELETE` with a request body.
+ *  New: `Headers.of(Map)` creates headers from a Map.
+
+
+## Version 2.2.0
+
+_2014-12-30_
+
+ *  **`RequestBody.contentLength()` now throws `IOException`.**
+    This is a source-incompatible change. If you have code that calls
+    `RequestBody.contentLength()`, your compile will break with this
+    update. The change is binary-compatible, however: code compiled
+    for OkHttp 2.0 and 2.1 will continue to work with this update.
+
+ *  **`COMPATIBLE_TLS` no longer supports SSLv3.** In response to the
+    [POODLE](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html)
+    vulnerability, OkHttp no longer offers SSLv3 when negotiation an
+    HTTPS connection. If you continue to need to connect to webservers
+    running SSLv3, you must manually configure your own `ConnectionSpec`.
+
+ *  **OkHttp now offers interceptors.** Interceptors are a powerful mechanism
+    that can monitor, rewrite, and retry calls. The [interceptors doc][interceptors] is a full
+    introduction to this new API.
+
+ *  New: APIs to iterate and selectively clear the response cache.
+ *  New: Support for SOCKS proxies.
+ *  New: Support for `TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV`.
+ *  New: Update HTTP/2 support to `h2-16` and `hpack-10`.
+ *  New: APIs to prevent retrying non-idempotent requests.
+ *  Fix: Drop NPN support. Going forward we support ALPN only.
+ *  Fix: The hostname verifier is now strict. This is consistent with the hostname
+    verifier in modern browsers.
+ *  Fix: Improve `CONNECT` handling for misbehaving HTTP proxies.
+ *  Fix: Don't retry requests that failed due to timeouts.
+ *  Fix: Cache 302s and 308s that include appropriate response headers.
+ *  Fix: Improve pooling of connections that use proxy selectors.
+ *  Fix: Don't leak connections when using ALPN on the desktop.
+ *  Fix: Update Jetty ALPN to `7.1.2.v20141202` (Java 7) and `8.1.2.v20141202` (Java 8).
+    This fixes a bug in resumed TLS sessions where the wrong protocol could be
+    selected.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash in SPDY and HTTP/2 when disconnecting before connecting.
+ *  Fix: Avoid a reverse DNS-lookup for a numeric proxy address
+ *  Fix: Resurrect http/2 frame logging.
+ *  Fix: Limit to 20 authorization attempts.
+
+## Version 2.1.0
+
+_2014-11-11_
+
+ *  New: Typesafe APIs for interacting with cipher suites and TLS versions.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when mixing authorization challenges with upload retries.
+
+
+## Version 2.1.0-RC1
+
+_2014-11-04_
+
+ *  **OkHttp now caches private responses**. We've changed from a shared cache
+    to a private cache, and will now store responses that use an `Authorization`
+    header. This means OkHttp's cache shouldn't be used on middleboxes that sit
+    between user agents and the origin server.
+
+ *  **TLS configuration updated.** OkHttp now explicitly enables TLSv1.2,
+    TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 where they are supported. It will continue to perform
+    only one fallback, to SSLv3. Applications can now configure this with the
+    `ConnectionSpec` class.
+
+    To disable TLS fallback:
+
+    ```java
+    client.setConnectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(
+        ConnectionSpec.MODERN_TLS, ConnectionSpec.CLEARTEXT));
+    ```
+
+    To disable cleartext connections, permitting `https` URLs only:
+
+    ```java
+    client.setConnectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(
+        ConnectionSpec.MODERN_TLS, ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS));
+    ```
+
+ *  **New cipher suites.** Please confirm that your webservers are reachable
+    with this limited set of cipher suites.
+
+    ```

+      <version>1.0.1</version>
+    </dependency>
+    ```
+
+ *  **New APIs to permit easy certificate pinning.** Be warned, certificate
+    pinning is dangerous and could prevent your application from trusting your
+    server!
+
+ *  **Cache improvements.** This release fixes some severe cache problems
+    including a bug where the cache could be corrupted upon certain access
+    patterns. We also fixed a bug where the cache was being cleared due to a
+    corrupted journal. We've added APIs to configure a request's `Cache-Control`
+    headers, and to manually clear the cache.
+
+ *  **Request cancellation fixes.** This update fixes a bug where synchronous
+    requests couldn't be canceled by tag. This update avoids crashing when
+    `onResponse()` throws an `IOException`. That failure will now be logged
+    instead of notifying the thread's uncaught exception handler. We've added a
+    new API, `Call.isCanceled()` to check if a call has been canceled.
+
+ *  New: Update `MultipartBuilder` to support content length.
+ *  New: Make it possible to mock `OkHttpClient` and `Call`.
+ *  New: Update to h2-14 and hpack-9.
+ *  New: OkHttp includes a user-agent by default, like `okhttp/2.1.0-RC1`.
+ *  Fix: Handle response code `308 Permanent Redirect`.
+ *  Fix: Don't skip the callback if a call is canceled.
+ *  Fix: Permit hostnames with underscores.
+ *  Fix: Permit overriding the content-type in `OkApacheClient`.
+ *  Fix: Use the socket factory for direct connections.
+ *  Fix: Honor `OkUrlFactory` APIs that disable redirects.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on concurrent modification of `SPDY` SPDY settings.
+
+## Version 2.0.0
+
+This release commits to a stable 2.0 API. Read the 2.0.0-RC1 changes for advice
+on upgrading from 1.x to 2.x.
+
+_2014-06-21_
+
+ *  **API Change**: Use `IOException` in `Callback.onFailure()`. This is
+    a source-incompatible change, and is different from OkHttp 2.0.0-RC2 which
+    used `Throwable`.
+ *  Fix: Fixed a caching bug where we weren't storing rewritten request headers
+    like `Accept-Encoding`.
+ *  Fix: Fixed bugs in handling the SPDY window size. This was stalling certain
+    large downloads
+ *  Update the language level to Java 7. (OkHttp requires Android 2.3+ or Java 7+.)
+
+## Version 2.0.0-RC2
+
+_2014-06-11_
+
+This update fixes problems in 2.0.0-RC1. Read the 2.0.0-RC1 changes for
+advice on upgrading from 1.x to 2.x.
+
+ *  Fix: Don't leak connections! There was a regression in 2.0.0-RC1 where
+    connections were neither closed nor pooled.
+ *  Fix: Revert builder-style return types from OkHttpClient's timeout methods
+    for binary compatibility with OkHttp 1.x.
+ *  Fix: Don't skip client stream 1 on SPDY/3.1. This fixes SPDY connectivity to
+    `https://google.com`, which doesn't follow the SPDY/3.1 spec!
+ *  Fix: Always configure NPN headers. This fixes connectivity to
+    `https://facebook.com` when SPDY and HTTP/2 are both disabled. Otherwise an
+    unexpected NPN response is received and OkHttp crashes.
+ *  Fix: Write continuation frames when HPACK data is larger than 16383 bytes.
+ *  Fix: Don't drop uncaught exceptions thrown in async calls.
+ *  Fix: Throw an exception eagerly when a request body is not legal. Previously
+    we ignored the problem at request-building time, only to crash later with a
+    `NullPointerException`.
+ *  Fix: Include a backwards-compatible `OkHttp-Response-Source` header with
+    `OkUrlFactory `responses.
+ *  Fix: Don't include a default User-Agent header in requests made with the Call
+    API. Requests made with OkUrlFactory will continue to have a default user
+    agent.
+ *  New: Guava-like API to create headers:
+
+    ```java
+    Headers headers = Headers.of(name1, value1, name2, value2, ...).
+    ```
+
+ *  New: Make the content-type header optional for request bodies.
+ *  New: `Response.isSuccessful()` is a convenient API to check response codes.
+ *  New: The response body can now be read outside of the callback. Response
+    bodies must always be closed, otherwise they will leak connections!
+ *  New: APIs to create multipart request bodies (`MultipartBuilder`) and form
+    encoding bodies (`FormEncodingBuilder`).
+
+## Version 2.0.0-RC1
+
+_2014-05-23_
+
+OkHttp 2 is designed around a new API that is true to HTTP, with classes for
+requests, responses, headers, and calls. It uses modern Java patterns like
+immutability and chained builders. The API now offers asynchronous callbacks
+in addition to synchronous blocking calls.
+
+#### API Changes
+
+ *  **New Request and Response types,** each with their own builder. There's also
+    a `RequestBody` class to write the request body to the network and a
+    `ResponseBody` to read the response body from the network. The standalone
+    `Headers` class offers full access to the HTTP headers.
+
+ *  **Okio dependency added.** OkHttp now depends on
+    [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio), an I/O library that makes it easier
+    to access, store and process data. Using this library internally makes OkHttp
+    faster while consuming less memory. You can write a `RequestBody` as an Okio
+    `BufferedSink` and a `ResponseBody` as an Okio `BufferedSource`. Standard
+    `InputStream` and `OutputStream` access is also available.
+
+ *  **New Call and Callback types** execute requests and receive their
+    responses. Both types of calls can be canceled via the `Call` or the
+    `OkHttpClient`.
+
+ *  **URLConnection support has moved to the okhttp-urlconnection module.**
+    If you're upgrading from 1.x, this change will impact you. You will need to
+    add the `okhttp-urlconnection` module to your project and use the
+    `OkUrlFactory` to create new instances of `HttpURLConnection`:
+
+    ```java
+    // OkHttp 1.x:
+    HttpURLConnection connection = client.open(url);
+
+    // OkHttp 2.x:
+    HttpURLConnection connection = new OkUrlFactory(client).open(url);
+    ```
+
+ *  **Custom caches are no longer supported.** In OkHttp 1.x it was possible to
+    define your own response cache with the `java.net.ResponseCache` and OkHttp's
+    `OkResponseCache` interfaces. Both of these APIs have been dropped. In
+    OkHttp 2 the built-in disk cache is the only supported response cache.
+
+ *  **HttpResponseCache has been renamed to Cache.** Install it with
+    `OkHttpClient.setCache(...)` instead of `OkHttpClient.setResponseCache(...)`.
+
+ *  **OkAuthenticator has been replaced with Authenticator.** This new
+    authenticator has access to the full incoming response and can respond with
+    whichever followup request is appropriate. The `Challenge` class is now a
+    top-level class and `Credential` is replaced with a utility class called
+    `Credentials`.
+
+ *  **OkHttpClient.getFollowProtocolRedirects() renamed to
+    getFollowSslRedirects()**. We reserve the word _protocol_ for the HTTP
+    version being used (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2). The old name of this method was
+    misleading; it was always used to configure redirects between `https://` and
+    `http://` schemes.
+
+ *  **RouteDatabase is no longer public API.** OkHttp continues to track which
+    routes have failed but this is no exposed in the API.
+
+ *  **ResponseSource is gone.** This enum exposed whether a response came from
+    the cache, network, or both. OkHttp 2 offers more detail with raw access to
+    the cache and network responses in the new `Response` class.
+
+ *  **TunnelRequest is gone.** It specified how to connect to an HTTP proxy.
+    OkHttp 2 uses the new `Request` class for this.
+
+ *  **Dispatcher** is a new class that manages the queue of asynchronous calls. It
+    implements limits on total in-flight calls and in-flight calls per host.
+
+#### Implementation changes
+
+ * Support Android `TrafficStats` socket tagging.
+ * Drop authentication headers on redirect.
+ * Added support for compressed data frames.
+ * Process push promise callbacks in order.
+ * Update to http/2 draft 12.
+ * Update to HPACK draft 07.
+ * Add ALPN support. Maven will use ALPN on OpenJDK 8.
+ * Update NPN dependency to target `jdk7u60-b13` and `Oracle jdk7u55-b13`.
+ * Ensure SPDY variants support zero-length DELETE and POST.
+ * Prevent leaking a cache item's InputStreams when metadata read fails.
+ * Use a string to identify TLS versions in routes.
+ * Add frame logger for HTTP/2.
+ * Replacing `httpMinorVersion` with `Protocol`. Expose HTTP/1.0 as a potential protocol.
+ * Use `Protocol` to describe framing.
+ * Implement write timeouts for HTTP/1.1 streams.
+ * Avoid use of SPDY stream ID 1, as that's typically used for UPGRADE.
+ * Support OAuth in `Authenticator`.
+ * Permit a dangling semicolon in media type parsing.

+OkHttp 3.x Change Log
+=====================
+
+## Version 3.14.9
+
+_2020-05-17_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable
+    platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it's running in a JVM or in Android.
+    The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp!
+
+
+## Version 3.14.8
+
+_2020-04-28_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and
+    above. See [Jetty's overview][jetty_8_252] of the API change and its consequences.
+
+## Version 3.14.7
+
+_2020-02-24_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on Android 11 due to use of restricted methods. This prevents a crash with the
+    exception, "Expected Android API level 21+ but was 29".
+
+
+## Version 3.14.6
+
+_2020-01-11_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash if the connection is closed when sending a degraded ping. This fixes a 
+    regression that was introduced in OkHttp 3.14.5.
+
+
+## Version 3.14.5
+
+_2020-01-03_
+
+ *  Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact
+    the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after 
+    a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling.
+
+
+## Version 3.14.4
+
+_2019-09-29_
+
+ *  Fix: Cancel calls that fail due to unexpected exceptions. We had a bug where an enqueued call
+    would never call back if it crashed with an unchecked throwable, such as a
+    `NullPointerException` or `OutOfMemoryError`. We now call `Callback.onFailure()` with an
+    `IOException` that reports the call as canceled. The triggering exception is still delivered to
+    the thread's `UncaughtExceptionHandler`.
+ *  Fix: Don't evict incomplete entries when iterating the cache. We had a bug where iterating
+    `Cache.urls()` would prevent in-flight entries from being written.
+
+
+## Version 3.14.3
+
+_2019-09-10_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this
+    happened enough then eventually the connection would stall.
+
+ *  Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we
+    could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to
+    fail the call.
+
+ *  Fix: Recover gracefully when a coalesced connection immediately goes unhealthy.
+
+## Version 3.14.2
+
+_2019-05-19_
+
+ *  Fix: Lock in a route when recovering from an HTTP/2 connection error. We had a bug where two
+    calls that failed at the same time could cause OkHttp to crash with a `NoSuchElementException`
+    instead of the expected `IOException`.
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash with a `NullPointerException` when formatting an error message describing a
+    truncated response from an HTTPS proxy.
+
+
+## Version 3.14.1
+
+_2019-04-10_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when an interceptor retries when there are no more routes. This was an
+    edge-case regression introduced with the events cleanup in 3.14.0.
+
+ *  Fix: Provide actionable advice when the exchange is non-null. Prior to 3.14, OkHttp would
+    silently leak connections when an interceptor retries without closing the response body. With
+    3.14 we detect this problem but the exception was not helpful.
+
+## Version 3.14.0
+
+_2019-03-14_
+
+ *  **This release deletes the long-deprecated `OkUrlFactory` and `OkApacheClient` APIs.** These
+    facades hide OkHttp's implementation behind another client's API. If you still need this please
+    copy and paste [ObsoleteUrlFactory.java][obsolete_url_factory] or
+    [ObsoleteApacheClient.java][obsolete_apache_client] into your project.
+
+ *  **OkHttp now supports duplex calls over HTTP/2.** With normal HTTP calls the request must finish
+    before the response starts. With duplex, request and response bodies are transmitted
+    simultaneously. This can be used to implement interactive conversations within a single HTTP
+    call.
+
+    Create duplex calls by overriding the new `RequestBody.isDuplex()` method to return true.
+    This simple option dramatically changes the behavior of the request body and of the entire
+    call.
+
+    The `RequestBody.writeTo()` method may now retain a reference to the provided sink and
+    hand it off to another thread to write to it after `writeTo` returns.
+
+    The `EventListener` may now see requests and responses interleaved in ways not previously
+    permitted. For example, a listener may receive `responseHeadersStart()` followed by
+    `requestBodyEnd()`, both on the same call. Such events may be triggered by different threads
+    even for a single call.
+
+    Interceptors that rewrite or replace the request body may now inadvertently interfere with
+    duplex request bodies. Such interceptors should check `RequestBody.isDuplex()` and avoid
+    accessing the request body when it is.
+
+    Duplex calls require HTTP/2. If HTTP/1 is established instead the duplex call will fail. The
+    most common use of duplex calls is [gRPC][grpc_http2].
+
+ *  New: Prevent OkHttp from retransmitting a request body by overriding `RequestBody.isOneShot()`.
+    This is most useful when writing the request body is destructive.
+
+ *  New: We've added `requestFailed()` and `responseFailed()` methods to `EventListener`. These
+    are called instead of `requestBodyEnd()` and `responseBodyEnd()` in some failure situations.
+    They may also be fired in cases where no event was published previously. In this release we did
+    an internal rewrite of our event code to fix problems where events were lost or unbalanced.
+
+ *  Fix: Don't leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the `onFailure()`
+    callback.
+
+ *  Fix: Apply call timeouts when connecting duplex calls, web sockets, and server-sent events.
+    Once the streams are established no further timeout is enforced.
+
+ *  Fix: Retain the `Route` when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was
+    causing some `Authenticator` calls to see a null route when non-null was expected.
+
+ *  Fix: Use the correct key size in the name of `TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` which is a TLS 1.3
+    cipher suite. We accidentally specified a key size of 256, preventing that cipher suite from
+    being selected for any TLS handshakes. We didn't notice because this cipher suite isn't
+    supported on Android, Java, or Conscrypt.
+
+    We removed this cipher suite and `TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256` from the restricted, modern, and
+    compatible sets of cipher suites. These two cipher suites aren't enabled by default in either
+    Firefox or Chrome.
+
+    See our [TLS Configuration History][tls_configuration_history] tracker for a log of all changes
+    to OkHttp's default TLS options.
+
+ *  New: Upgrade to Conscrypt 2.0.0. OkHttp works with other versions of Conscrypt but this is the
+    version we're testing against.
+
+    ```kotlin
+    implementation("org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber:2.0.0")
+    ```
+
+ *  New: Update the embedded public suffixes list.
+
+
+## Version 3.13.1
+
+_2019-02-05_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when using a custom `X509TrustManager` or `SSLSocket` on Android. When we
+    removed obsolete code for Android 4.4 we inadvertently also removed support for custom
+    subclasses. We've restored that support!
+
+
+## Version 3.13.0
+
+_2019-02-04_
+
+ *  **This release bumps our minimum requirements to Java 8+ or Android 5+.** Cutting off old
+    devices is a serious change and we don't do it lightly! [This post][require_android_5] explains
+    why we're doing this and how to upgrade.
+
+    The OkHttp 3.12.x branch will be our long-term branch for Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java
+    7+. These platforms lack support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is
+    difficult we will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2021. (This
+    commitment was originally through December 31, 2020; we have since extended it.)
+
+ *  **TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are no longer enabled by default.** Major web browsers are working towards
+    removing these versions altogether in early 2020. If your servers aren't ready yet you can
+    configure OkHttp 3.13 to allow TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connections:
+
+    ```
+    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
+        .connectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS))
+        .build();
+    ```
+
+ *  New: You can now access HTTP trailers with `Response.trailers()`. This method may only be called
+    after the entire HTTP response body has been read.
+
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.17.3. If you're on Kotlin-friendly Okio 2.x this release requires 2.2.2
+    or newer.
+
+    ```kotlin
+    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:1.17.3")
+    ```
+
+ *  Fix: Don't miss cancels when sending HTTP/2 request headers.
+ *  Fix: Don't miss whole operation timeouts when calls redirect.
+ *  Fix: Don't leak connections if web sockets have malformed responses or if `onOpen()` throws.
+ *  Fix: Don't retry when request bodies fail due to `FileNotFoundException`.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when URLs have IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when building `HandshakeCertificates` on Android API 28.
+ *  Fix: Permit multipart file names to contain non-ASCII characters.
+ *  New: API to get MockWebServer's dispatcher.
+ *  New: API to access headers as `java.time.Instant`.
+ *  New: Fail fast if a `SSLSocketFactory` is used as a `SocketFactory`.
+ *  New: Log the TLS handshake in `LoggingEventListener`.
+
+## Version 3.12.13
+
+_2021-01-30_
+
+ *  Fix: Work around a crash in Android 10 and 11 that may be triggered when two threads
+    concurrently close an SSL socket. This would have appeared in crash logs as
+    `NullPointerException: bio == null`.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.12
+
+_2020-05-17_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable
+    platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it's running in a JVM or in Android.
+    The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp!
+
+
+## Version 3.12.11
+
+_2020-04-28_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and
+    above. See [Jetty's overview][jetty_8_252] of the API change and its consequences.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.10
+
+_2020-02-29_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on Android 4.1 when detecting methods that became restricted in Android 11.
+    Supporting a full decade of Android releases on our 3.12.x branch is tricky!
+
+
+## Version 3.12.9
+
+_2020-02-24_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash on Android 11 due to use of restricted methods. This prevents a crash with the
+    exception, "Expected Android API level 21+ but was 29".
+
+
+## Version 3.12.8
+
+_2020-01-11_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash if the connection is closed when sending a degraded ping. This fixes a 
+    regression that was introduced in OkHttp 3.12.7.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.7
+
+_2020-01-03_
+
+ *  Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact
+    the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after 
+    a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.6
+
+_2019-09-29_
+
+ *  Fix: Cancel calls that fail due to unexpected exceptions. We had a bug where an enqueued call
+    would never call back if it crashed with an unchecked throwable, such as a
+    `NullPointerException` or `OutOfMemoryError`. We now call `Callback.onFailure()` with an
+    `IOException` that reports the call as canceled. The triggering exception is still delivered to
+    the thread's `UncaughtExceptionHandler`.
+ *  Fix: Don't evict incomplete entries when iterating the cache. We had a bug where iterating
+    `Cache.urls()` would prevent in-flight entries from being written.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.5
+
+_2019-09-10_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this
+    happened enough then eventually the connection would stall.
+
+ *  Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we
+    could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to
+    fail the call.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.4
+
+_2019-09-04_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash looking up an absent class on certain buggy Android 4.x devices.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.3
+
+_2019-05-07_
+
+ *  Fix: Permit multipart file names to contain non-ASCII characters.
+ *  Fix: Retain the `Route` when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was
+    causing some `Authenticator` calls to see a null route when non-null was expected.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.2
+
+_2019-03-14_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash if the HTTPS server returns no certificates in the TLS handshake.
+ *  Fix: Don't leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the `onFailure()`
+    callback.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.1
+
+_2018-12-23_
+
+ *  Fix: Remove overlapping `package-info.java`. This caused issues with some build tools.
+
+
+## Version 3.12.0
+
+_2018-11-16_
+
+ *  **OkHttp now supports TLS 1.3.** This requires either Conscrypt or Java 11+.
+
+ *  **Proxy authenticators are now asked for preemptive authentication.** OkHttp will now request
+    authentication credentials before creating TLS tunnels through HTTP proxies (HTTP `CONNECT`).
+    Authenticators should identify preemptive authentications by the presence of a challenge whose
+    scheme is "OkHttp-Preemptive".
+
+ *  **OkHttp now offers full-operation timeouts.** This sets a limit on how long the entire call may
+    take and covers resolving DNS, connecting, writing the request body, server processing, and
+    reading the full response body. If a call requires redirects or retries all must complete within
+    one timeout period.
+
+    Use `OkHttpClient.Builder.callTimeout()` to specify the default duration and `Call.timeout()` to
+    specify the timeout of an individual call.
+
+ *  New: Return values and fields are now non-null unless otherwise annotated.
+ *  New: `LoggingEventListener` makes it easy to get basic visibility into a call's performance.
+    This class is in the `logging-interceptor` artifact.
+ *  New: `Headers.Builder.addUnsafeNonAscii()` allows non-ASCII values to be added without an
+    immediate exception.
+ *  New: Headers can be redacted in `HttpLoggingInterceptor`.
+ *  New: `Headers.Builder` now accepts dates.
+ *  New: OkHttp now accepts `java.time.Duration` for timeouts on Java 8+ and Android 26+.
+ *  New: `Challenge` includes all authentication parameters.
+ *  New: Upgrade to BouncyCastle 1.60, Conscrypt 1.4.0, and Okio 1.15.0. We don't yet require
+    Kotlin-friendly Okio 2.x but OkHttp works fine with that series.
+
+    ```kotlin
+    implementation("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.60")
+    implementation("org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber:1.4.0")
+    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:1.15.0")
+    ```
+
+ *  Fix: Handle dispatcher executor shutdowns gracefully. When there aren't any threads to carry a
+    call its callback now gets a `RejectedExecutionException`.
+ *  Fix: Don't permanently cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. We misunderstood the
+    original `immutable` proposal!
+ *  Fix: Change `Authenticator`'s `Route` parameter to be nullable. This was marked as non-null but
+    could be called with null in some cases.
+ *  Fix: Don't create malformed URLs when `MockWebServer` is reached via an IPv6 address.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash if the system default authenticator is null.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash generating elliptic curve certificates on Android.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash doing platform detection on RoboVM.
+ *  Fix: Don't leak socket connections when web socket upgrades fail.
+
+
+## Version 3.11.0
+
+_2018-07-12_
+
+ *  **OkHttp's new okhttp-tls submodule tames HTTPS and TLS.**
+
+    `HeldCertificate` is a TLS certificate and its private key. Generate a certificate with its
+    builder then use it to sign another certificate or perform a TLS handshake. The
+    `certificatePem()` method encodes the certificate in the familiar PEM format
+    (`--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---`); the `privateKeyPkcs8Pem()` does likewise for the private key.
+
+    `HandshakeCertificates` holds the TLS certificates required for a TLS handshake. On the server
+    it keeps your `HeldCertificate` and its chain. On the client it keeps the root certificates
+    that are trusted to sign a server's certificate chain. `HandshakeCertificates` also works with
+    mutual TLS where these roles are reversed.
+
+    These classes make it possible to enable HTTPS in MockWebServer in [just a few lines of
+    code][https_server_sample].
+
+ *  **OkHttp now supports prior knowledge cleartext HTTP/2.** Enable this by setting
+    `Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE` as the lone protocol on an `OkHttpClient.Builder`. This mode
+    only supports `http:` URLs and is best suited in closed environments where HTTPS is
+    inappropriate.
+
+ *  New: `HttpUrl.get(String)` is an alternative to `HttpUrl.parse(String)` that throws an exception
+    when the URL is malformed instead of returning null. Use this to avoid checking for null in
+    situations where the input is known to be well-formed. We've also added `MediaType.get(String)`
+    which is an exception-throwing alternative to `MediaType.parse(String)`.
+ *  New: The `EventListener` API previewed in OkHttp 3.9 has graduated to a stable API. Use this
+    interface to track metrics and monitor HTTP requests' size and duration.
+ *  New: `okhttp-dnsoverhttps` is an experimental API for doing DNS queries over HTTPS. Using HTTPS
+    for DNS offers better security and potentially better performance. This feature is a preview:
+    the API is subject to change.
+ *  New: `okhttp-sse` is an early preview of Server-Sent Events (SSE). This feature is incomplete
+    and is only suitable for experimental use.
+ *  New: MockWebServer now supports client authentication (mutual TLS). Call `requestClientAuth()`
+    to permit an optional client certificate or `requireClientAuth()` to require one.
+ *  New: `RecordedRequest.getHandshake()` returns the HTTPS handshake of a request sent to
+    `MockWebServer`.
+ *  Fix: Honor the `MockResponse` header delay in MockWebServer.
+ *  Fix: Don't release HTTP/2 connections that have multiple canceled calls. We had a bug where
+    canceling calls would cause the shared HTTP/2 connection to be unnecessarily released. This
+    harmed connection reuse.
+ *  Fix: Ensure canceled and discarded HTTP/2 data is not permanently counted against the limited
+    flow control window. We had a few bugs where window size accounting was broken when streams
+    were canceled or reset.
+ *  Fix: Recover gracefully if the TLS session returns an unexpected version (`NONE`) or cipher
+    suite (`SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`).
+ *  Fix: Don't change Conscrypt configuration globally. We migrated from a process-wide setting to
+    configuring only OkHttp's TLS sockets.
+ *  Fix: Prefer TLSv1.2 where it is available. On certain older platforms it is necessary to opt-in
+    to TLSv1.2.
+ *  New: `Request.tag()` permits multiple tags. Use a `Class<?>` as a key to identify tags. Note
+    that `tag()` now returns null if the request has no tag. Previously this would return the
+    request itself.
+ *  New: `Headers.Builder.addAll(Headers)`.
+ *  New: `ResponseBody.create(MediaType, ByteString)`.
+ *  New: Embed R8/ProGuard rules in the jar. These will be applied automatically by R8.
+ *  Fix: Release the connection if `Authenticator` throws an exception.
+ *  Fix: Change the declaration of `OkHttpClient.cache()` to return a `@Nullable Cache`. The return
+    value has always been nullable but it wasn't declared properly.
+ *  Fix: Reverse suppression of connect exceptions. When both a call and its retry fail, we now
+    throw the initial exception which is most likely to be actionable.
+ *  Fix: Retain interrupted state when throwing `InterruptedIOException`. A single interrupt should
+    now be sufficient to break out an in-flight OkHttp call.
+ *  Fix: Don't drop a call to `EventListener.callEnd()` when the response body is consumed inside an
+    interceptor.
+
+
+## Version 3.10.0
+
+_2018-02-24_
+
+ *  **The pingInterval() feature now aggressively checks connectivity for web
+    sockets and HTTP/2 connections.**
+
+    Previously if you configured a ping interval that would cause OkHttp to send
+    pings, but it did not track whether the reply pongs were received. With this
+    update OkHttp requires that every ping receive a response: if it does not
+    the connection will be closed and the listener's `onFailure()` method will
+    be called.
+
+    Web sockets have always been had pings, but pings on HTTP/2 connections is
+    new in this release. Pings are used for connections that are busy carrying
+    calls and for idle connections in the connection pool. (Pings do not impact
+    when pooled connections are evicted).
+
+    If you have a configured ping interval, you should confirm that it is long
+    enough for a roundtrip from client to server. If your ping interval is too
+    short, slow connections may be misinterpreted as failed connections. A ping
+    interval of 30 seconds is reasonable for most use cases.
+
+ *  **OkHttp now supports [Conscrypt][conscrypt].** Conscrypt is a Java Security
+    Provider that integrates BoringSSL into the Java platform. Conscrypt
+    supports more cipher suites than the JVM’s default provider and may also
+    execute more efficiently.
+
+    To use it, first register a [Conscrypt dependency][conscrypt_dependency] in
+    your build system.
+
+    OkHttp will use Conscrypt if you set the `okhttp.platform` system property
+    to `conscrypt`.
+
+    Alternatively, OkHttp will also use Conscrypt if you install it as your
+    preferred security provider. To do so, add the following code to execute
+    before you create your `OkHttpClient`.
+
+    ```
+    Security.insertProviderAt(
+        new org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider(), 1);
+    ```
+
+    Conscrypt is the bundled security provider on Android so it is not necessary
+    to configure it on that platform.
+
+ *  New: `HttpUrl.addQueryParameter()` percent-escapes more characters.
+    Previously several ASCII punctuation characters were not percent-escaped
+    when used with this method. This does not impact already-encoded query
+    parameters in APIs like `HttpUrl.parse()` and
+    `HttpUrl.Builder.addEncodedQueryParameter()`.
+ *  New: CBC-mode ECDSA cipher suites have been removed from OkHttp's default
+    configuration: `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` and
+    `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`. This tracks a [Chromium
+    change][remove_cbc_ecdsa] to remove these cipher suites because they are
+    fragile and rarely-used.
+ *  New: Don't fall back to common name (CN) verification for hostnames. This
+    behavior was deprecated with RFC 2818 in May 2000 and was recently dropped
+    from major web browsers.
+ *  New: Honor the `Retry-After` response header. HTTP 503 (Unavailable)
+    responses are retried automatically if this header is present and its delay
+    is 0 seconds. HTTP 408 (Client Timeout) responses are retried automatically
+    if the header is absent or its delay is 0 seconds.
+ *  New: Allow request bodies for all HTTP methods except GET and HEAD.
+ *  New: Automatic module name of `okhttp3` for use with the Java Platform
+    Module System.
+ *  New: Log gzipped bodies when `HttpLoggingInterceptor` is used as a network
+    interceptor.
+ *  New: `Protocol.QUIC` constant. This protocol is not supported but this
+    constant is included for completeness.
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.14.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.14.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+
+     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.14.0
+     ```
+
+ *  Fix: Handle `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` status lines, even on requests that did
+    not send the `Expect: continue` request header.
+ *  Fix: Do not count web sockets toward the dispatcher's per-host connection
+    limit.
+ *  Fix: Avoid using invalid HTTPS sessions. This prevents OkHttp from crashing
+    with the error, `Unexpected TLS version: NONE`.
+ *  Fix: Don't corrupt the response cache when a 304 (Not Modified) response
+    overrides the stored "Content-Encoding" header.
+ *  Fix: Gracefully shut down the HTTP/2 connection before it exhausts the
+    namespace of stream IDs (~536 million streams).
+ *  Fix: Never pass a null `Route` to `Authenticator`. There was a bug where
+    routes were omitted for eagerly-closed connections.
+
+## Version 3.9.1
+
+_2017-11-18_
+
+ *  New: Recover gracefully when Android's DNS crashes with an unexpected
+    `NullPointerException`.
+ *  New: Recover gracefully when Android's socket connections crash with an
+    unexpected `ClassCastException`.
+ *  Fix: Don't include the URL's fragment in `encodedQuery()` when the query
+    itself is empty.
+
+## Version 3.9.0
+
+_2017-09-03_
+
+ *  **Interceptors are more capable.** The `Chain` interface now offers access
+    to the call and can adjust all call timeouts. Note that this change is
+    source-incompatible for code that implements the `Chain` interface.
+    We don't expect this to be a problem in practice!
+
+ *  **OkHttp has an experimental new API for tracking metrics.** The new
+    `EventListener` API is designed to help developers monitor HTTP requests'
+    size and duration. This feature is an unstable preview: the API is subject
+    to change, and the implementation is incomplete. This is a big new API we
+    are eager for feedback.
+
+ *  New: Support ALPN via Google Play Services' Dynamic Security Provider. This
+    expands HTTP/2 support to older Android devices that have Google Play
+    Services.
+ *  New: Consider all routes when looking for candidate coalesced connections.
+    This increases the likelihood that HTTP/2 connections will be shared.
+ *  New: Authentication challenges and credentials now use a charset. Use this in
+    your authenticator to support user names and passwords with non-ASCII
+    characters.
+ *  New: Accept a charset in `FormBody.Builder`. Previously form bodies were
+    always UTF-8.
+ *  New: Support the `immutable` cache-control directive.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when an HTTP/2 call is redirected while the connection is
+    being shut down.
+ *  Fix: Don't drop headers of healthy streams that raced with `GOAWAY` frames.
+    This bug would cause HTTP/2 streams to occasional hang when the connection
+    was shutting down.
+ *  Fix: Honor `OkHttpClient.retryOnConnectionFailure()` when the response is a
+    HTTP 408 Request Timeout. If retries are enabled, OkHttp will retry exactly
+    once in response to a 408.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when reading the empty `HEAD` response body if it specifies
+    a `Content-Length`.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash if the thread is interrupted while reading the public
+    suffix database.
+ *  Fix: Use relative resource path when loading the public suffix database.
+    Loading the resource using a path relative to the class prevents conflicts
+    when the OkHttp classes are relocated (shaded) by allowing multiple private
+    copies of the database.
+ *  Fix: Accept cookies for URLs that have an IPv6 address for a host.
+ *  Fix: Don't log the protocol (HTTP/1.1, h2) in HttpLoggingInterceptor if the
+    protocol isn't negotiated yet! Previously we'd log HTTP/1.1 by default, and
+    this was confusing.
+ *  Fix: Omit the message from MockWebServer's HTTP/2 `:status` header.
+ *  Fix: Handle 'Expect: 100 Continue' properly in MockWebServer.
+
+
+## Version 3.8.1
+
+_2017-06-18_
+
+ *  Fix: Recover gracefully from stale coalesced connections. We had a bug where
+    connection coalescing (introduced in OkHttp 3.7.0) and stale connection
+    recovery could interact to cause a `NoSuchElementException` crash in the
+    `RouteSelector`.
+
+
+## Version 3.8.0
+
+_2017-05-13_
+
+
+ *  **OkHttp now uses `@Nullable` to annotate all possibly-null values.** We've
+    added a compile-time dependency on the JSR 305 annotations. This is a
+    [provided][maven_provided] dependency and does not need to be included in
+    your build configuration, `.jar` file, or `.apk`. We use
+    `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` and all parameters and return types are
+    never null unless explicitly annotated `@Nullable`.
+
+ *  **Warning: this release is source-incompatible for Kotlin users.**
+    Nullability was previously ambiguous and lenient but now the compiler will
+    enforce strict null checks.
+
+ *  New: The response message is now non-null. This is the "Not Found" in the
+    status line "HTTP 404 Not Found". If you are building responses
+    programmatically (with `new Response.Builder()`) you must now always supply
+    a message. An empty string `""` is permitted. This value was never null on
+    responses returned by OkHttp itself, and it was an old mistake to permit
+    application code to omit a message.
+
+ *  The challenge's scheme and realm are now non-null. If you are calling
+    `new Challenge(scheme, realm)` you must provide non-null values. These were
+    never null in challenges created by OkHttp, but could have been null in
+    application code that creates challenges.
+
+ *  New: The `TlsVersion` of a `Handshake` is now non-null. If you are calling
+    `Handshake.get()` with a null TLS version, you must instead now provide a
+    non-null `TlsVersion`. Cache responses persisted prior to OkHttp 3.0 did not
+    store a TLS version; for these unknown values the handshake is defaulted to
+    `TlsVersion.SSL_3_0`.
+
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.13.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.13.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+
+     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.13.0
+     ```
+
+ *  Fix: gracefully recover when Android 7.0's sockets throw an unexpected
+    `NullPointerException`.
+
+## Version 3.7.0
+
+_2017-04-15_
+
+ *  **OkHttp no longer recovers from TLS handshake failures by attempting a TLSv1 connection.**
+    The fallback was necessary for servers that implemented version negotiation incorrectly. Now
+    that 99.99% of servers do it right this fallback is obsolete.
+ *  Fix: Do not honor cookies set on a public domain. Previously a malicious site could inject
+    cookies on top-level domains like `co.uk` because our cookie parser didn't honor the [public
+    suffix][public_suffix] list. Alongside this fix is a new API, `HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain()`,
+    which returns the privately domain name if the URL has one.
+ *  Fix: Change `MediaType.charset()` to return null for unexpected charsets.
+ *  Fix: Don't skip cache invalidation if the invalidating response has no body.
+ *  Fix: Don't use a cryptographic random number generator for web sockets. Some Android devices
+    implement `SecureRandom` incorrectly!
+ *  Fix: Correctly canonicalize IPv6 addresses in `HttpUrl`. This prevented OkHttp from trusting
+    HTTPS certificates issued to certain IPv6 addresses.
+ *  Fix: Don't reuse connections after an unsuccessful `Expect: 100-continue`.
+ *  Fix: Handle either `TLS_` or `SSL_` prefixes for cipher suite names. This is necessary for
+    IBM JVMs that use the `SSL_` prefix exclusively.
+ *  Fix: Reject HTTP/2 data frames if the stream ID is 0.
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.12.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.12.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+
+     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.12.0
+     ```
+
+ *  New: Connection coalescing. OkHttp may reuse HTTP/2 connections across calls that share an IP
+    address and HTTPS certificate, even if their domain names are different.
+ *  New: MockWebServer's `RecordedRequest` exposes the requested `HttpUrl` with `getRequestUrl()`.
+
+
+## Version 3.6.0
+
+_2017-01-29_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash with a "cache is closed" error when there is an error initializing the cache.
+ *  Fix: Calling `disconnect()` on a connecting `HttpUrlConnection` could cause it to retry in an
+    infinite loop! This regression was introduced in OkHttp 2.7.0.
+ *  Fix: Drop cookies that contain ASCII NULL and other bad characters. Previously such cookies
+    would cause OkHttp to crash when they were included in a request.
+ *  Fix: Release duplicated multiplexed connections. If we concurrently establish connections to an
+    HTTP/2 server, close all but the first connection.
+ *  Fix: Fail the HTTP/2 connection if first frame isn't `SETTINGS`.
+ *  Fix: Forbid spaces in header names.
+ *  Fix: Don't offer to do gzip if the request is partial.
+ *  Fix: MockWebServer is now usable with JUnit 5. That update [broke the rules][junit_5_rules].
+ *  New: Support `Expect: 100-continue` as a request header. Callers can use this header to
+    pessimistically hold off on transmitting a request body until a server gives the go-ahead.
+ *  New: Permit network interceptors to rewrite the host header for HTTP/2. This makes it possible
+    to do domain fronting.
+ *  New: charset support for `Credentials.basic()`.
+
+
+## Version 3.5.0
+
+_2016-11-30_
+
+ *  **Web Sockets are now a stable feature of OkHttp.** Since being introduced as a beta feature in
+    OkHttp 2.3 our web socket client has matured. Connect to a server's web socket with
+    `OkHttpClient.newWebSocket()`, send messages with `send()`, and receive messages with the
+    `WebSocketListener`.
+
+    The `okhttp-ws` submodule is no longer available and `okhttp-ws` artifacts from previous
+    releases of OkHttp are not compatible with OkHttp 3.5. When upgrading to the new package
+    please note that the `WebSocket` and `WebSocketCall` classes have been merged. Sending messages
+    is now asynchronous and they may be enqueued before the web socket is connected.
+
+ *  **OkHttp no longer attempts a direct connection if the system's HTTP proxy fails.** This
+    behavior was surprising because OkHttp was disregarding the user's specified configuration. If
+    you need to customize proxy fallback behavior, implement your own `java.net.ProxySelector`.
+
+ *  Fix: Support TLSv1.3 on devices that support it.
+
+ *  Fix: Share pooled connections across equivalent `OkHttpClient` instances. Previous releases had
+    a bug where a shared connection pool did not guarantee shared connections in some cases.
+ *  Fix: Prefer the server's response body on all conditional cache misses. Previously we would
+    return the cached response's body if it had a newer `Last-Modified` date.
+ *  Fix: Update the stored timestamp on conditional cache hits.
+ *  New: Optimized HTTP/2 request header encoding. More headers are HPACK-encoded and string
+    literals are now Huffman-encoded.
+ *  New: Expose `Part` headers and body in `Multipart`.
+ *  New: Make `ResponseBody.string()` and `ResponseBody.charStream()` BOM-aware. If your HTTP
+    response body begins with a [byte order mark][bom] it will be consumed and used to select a
+    charset for the remaining bytes. Most applications should not need a byte order mark.
+
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.11.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.11.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+
+     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.11.0
+     ```
+
+ *  Fix: Avoid sending empty HTTP/2 data frames when there is no request body.
+ *  Fix: Add a leading `.` for better domain matching in `JavaNetCookieJar`.
+ *  Fix: Gracefully recover from HTTP/2 connection shutdowns at start of request.
+ *  Fix: Be lenient if a `MediaType`'s character set is `'single-quoted'`.
+ *  Fix: Allow horizontal tab characters in header values.
+ *  Fix: When parsing HTTP authentication headers permit challenge parameters in any order.
+
+
+## Version 3.4.2
+
+_2016-11-03_
+
+ *  Fix: Recover gracefully when an HTTP/2 connection is shutdown. We had a
+    bug where shutdown HTTP/2 connections were considered usable. This caused
+    infinite loops when calls attempted to recover.
+
+
+## Version 3.4.1
+
+_2016-07-10_
+
+ *  **Fix a major bug in encoding HTTP headers.** In 3.4.0 and 3.4.0-RC1 OkHttp
+    had an off-by-one bug in our HPACK encoder. This bug could have caused the
+    wrong headers to be emitted after a sequence of HTTP/2 requests! Everyone
+    who is using OkHttp 3.4.0 or 3.4.0-RC1 should upgrade for this bug fix.
+
+
+## Version 3.4.0
+
+_2016-07-08_
+
+ *  New: Support dynamic table size changes to HPACK Encoder.
+ *  Fix: Use `TreeMap` in `Headers.toMultimap()`. This makes string lookups on
+    the returned map case-insensitive.
+ *  Fix: Don't share the OkHttpClient's `Dispatcher` in `HttpURLConnection`.
+
+
+## Version 3.4.0-RC1
+
+_2016-07-02_
+
+ *  **We’ve rewritten HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection.** Previously we
+    shared a single HTTP engine between two frontend APIs: `HttpURLConnection`
+    and `Call`. With this release we’ve rearranged things so that the
+    `HttpURLConnection` frontend now delegates to the `Call` APIs internally.
+    This has enabled substantial simplifications and optimizations in the OkHttp
+    core for both frontends.
+
+    For most HTTP requests the consequences of this change will be negligible.
+    If your application uses `HttpURLConnection.connect()`,
+    `setFixedLengthStreamingMode()`, or `setChunkedStreamingMode()`, OkHttp will
+    now use a async dispatcher thread to establish the HTTP connection.
+
+    We don’t expect this change to have any behavior or performance
+    consequences. Regardless, please exercise your `OkUrlFactory` and
+    `HttpURLConnection` code when applying this update.
+
+ *  **Cipher suites may now have arbitrary names.** Previously `CipherSuite` was
+    a Java enum and it was impossible to define new cipher suites without first
+    upgrading OkHttp. With this change it is now a regular Java class with
+    enum-like constants. Application code that uses enum methods on cipher
+    suites (`ordinal()`, `name()`, etc.) will break with this change.
+
+ *  Fix: `CertificatePinner` now matches canonicalized hostnames. Previously
+    this was case sensitive. This change should also make it easier to configure
+    certificate pinning for internationalized domain names.
+ *  Fix: Don’t crash on non-ASCII `ETag` headers. Previously OkHttp would reject
+    these headers when validating a cached response.
+ *  Fix: Don’t allow remote peer to arbitrarily size the HPACK decoder dynamic
+    table.
+ *  Fix: Honor per-host configuration in Android’s network security config.
+    Previously disabling cleartext for any host would disable cleartext for all
+    hosts. Note that this setting is only available on Android 24+.
+ *  New: HPACK compression is now dynamic. This should improve performance when
+    transmitting request headers over HTTP/2.
+ *  New: `Dispatcher.setIdleCallback()` can be used to signal when there are no
+    calls in flight. This is useful for [testing with
+    Espresso][okhttp_idling_resource].
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.9.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.9.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+     ```
+
+
+## Version 3.3.1
+
+_2016-05-28_
+
+ *  Fix: The plaintext check in HttpLoggingInterceptor incorrectly classified
+    newline characters as control characters. This is fixed.
+ *  Fix: Don't crash reading non-ASCII characters in HTTP/2 headers or in cached
+    HTTP headers.
+ *  Fix: Retain the response body when an attempt to open a web socket returns a
+    non-101 response code.
+
+
+## Version 3.3.0
+
+_2016-05-24_
+
+ *  New: `Response.sentRequestAtMillis()` and `receivedResponseAtMillis()`
+    methods track the system's local time when network calls are made. These
+    replace the `OkHttp-Sent-Millis` and `OkHttp-Received-Millis` headers that were
+    present in earlier versions of OkHttp.
+ *  New: Accept user-provided trust managers in `OkHttpClient.Builder`. This
+    allows OkHttp to satisfy its TLS requirements directly. Otherwise OkHttp
+    will use reflection to extract the `TrustManager` from the
+    `SSLSocketFactory`.
+ *  New: Support prerelease Java 9. This gets ALPN from the platform rather than
+    relying on the alpn-boot bootclasspath override.
+ *  New: `HttpLoggingInterceptor` now logs connection failures.
+ *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.8.0.
+
+     ```xml
+     <dependency>
+       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
+       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
+       <version>1.8.0</version>
+     </dependency>
+     ```
+
+ *  Fix: Gracefully recover from a failure to rebuild the cache journal.
+ *  Fix: Don't corrupt cache entries when a cache entry is evicted while it is
+    being updated.
+ *  Fix: Make logging more consistent throughout OkHttp.
+ *  Fix: Log plaintext bodies only. This uses simple heuristics to differentiate
+    text from other data.
+ *  Fix: Recover from `REFUSED_STREAM` errors in HTTP/2. This should improve
+    interoperability with Nginx 1.10.0, which [refuses][nginx_959] streams
+    created before HTTP/2 settings have been acknowledged.
+ *  Fix: Improve recovery from failed routes.
+ *  Fix: Accommodate tunneling proxies that close the connection after an auth
+    challenge.
+ *  Fix: Use the proxy authenticator when authenticating HTTP proxies. This
+    regression was introduced in OkHttp 3.0.
+ *  Fix: Fail fast if network interceptors transform the response body such that
+    closing it doesn't also close the underlying stream. We had a bug where
+    OkHttp would attempt to reuse a connection but couldn't because it was still
+    held by a prior request.
+ *  Fix: Ensure network interceptors always have access to the underlying
+    connection.
+ *  Fix: Use `X509TrustManagerExtensions` on Android 17+.
+ *  Fix: Unblock waiting dispatchers on MockWebServer shutdown.
+
+
+## Version 3.2.0
+
+_2016-02-25_
+
+ *  Fix: Change the certificate pinner to always build full chains. This
+    prevents a potential crash when using certificate pinning with the Google
+    Play Services security provider.
+ *  Fix: Make IPv6 request lines consistent with Firefox and Chrome.
+ *  Fix: Recover gracefully when trimming the response cache fails.
+ *  New: Add multiple path segments using a single string in `HttpUrl.Builder`.
+ *  New: Support SHA-256 pins in certificate pinner.
+
+
+## Version 3.1.2
+
+_2016-02-10_
+
+ *  Fix: Don’t crash when finding the trust manager on Robolectric. We attempted
+    to detect the host platform and got confused because Robolectric looks like
+    Android but isn’t!
+ *  Fix: Change `CertificatePinner` to skip sanitizing the certificate chain
+    when no certificates were pinned. This avoids an SSL failure in insecure
+    “trust everyone” configurations, such as when talking to a development
+    HTTPS server that has a self-signed certificate.
+
+
+## Version 3.1.1
+
+_2016-02-07_
+
+ *  Fix: Don't crash when finding the trust manager if the Play Services (GMS)
+    security provider is installed.
+ *  Fix: The previous release introduced a performance regression on Android,
+    caused by looking up CA certificates. This is now fixed.
+
+
+## Version 3.1.0
+
+_2016-02-06_
+
+ *  New: WebSockets now defer some writes. This should improve performance for
+    some applications.
+ *  New: Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` in our new cookie class. This
+    class now defines equality by value rather than by reference.
+ *  New: Handle 408 responses by retrying the request. This allows servers to
+    direct clients to retry rather than failing permanently.
+ *  New: Expose the framed protocol in `Connection`. Previously this would
+    return the application-layer protocol (HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0); now it always
+    returns the wire-layer protocol (HTTP/2, SPDY/3.1, or HTTP/1.1).
+ *  Fix: Permit the trusted CA root to be pinned by `CertificatePinner`.
+ *  Fix: Silently ignore unknown HTTP/2 settings. Previously this would cause
+    the entire connection to fail.
+ *  Fix: Don’t crash on unexpected charsets in the logging interceptor.
+ *  Fix: `OkHttpClient` is now non-final for the benefit of mocking frameworks.
+    Mocking sophisticated classes like `OkHttpClient` is fragile and you
+    shouldn’t do it. But if that’s how you want to live your life we won’t stand
+    in your way!
+
+
+## Version 3.0.1
+
+_2016-01-14_
+
+ *  Rollback OSGi support. This was causing library jars to include more classes
+    than expected, which interfered with Gradle builds.
+
+
+## Version 3.0.0
+
+_2016-01-13_
+
+This release commits to a stable 3.0 API. Read the 3.0.0-RC1 changes for advice
+on upgrading from 2.x to 3.x.
+
+ *  **The `Callback` interface now takes a `Call`**. This makes it easier to
+    check if the call was canceled from within the callback. When migrating
+    async calls to this new API, `Call` is now the first parameter for both
+    `onResponse()` and `onFailure()`.
+ *  Fix: handle multiple cookies in `JavaNetCookieJar` on Android.
+ *  Fix: improve the default HTTP message in MockWebServer responses.
+ *  Fix: don't leak file handles when a conditional GET throws.
+ *  Fix: Use charset specified by the request body content type in OkHttp's
+    logging interceptor.
+ *  Fix: Don't eagerly release pools on cache hits.
+ *  New: Make OkHttp OSGi ready.
+ *  New: Add already-implemented interfaces Closeable and Flushable to the cache.
+
+
+## Version 3.0.0-RC1
+
+_2016-01-02_
+
+OkHttp 3 is a major release focused on API simplicity and consistency. The API
+changes are numerous but most are cosmetic. Applications should be able to
+upgrade from the 2.x API to the 3.x API mechanically and without risk.
+
+Because the release includes breaking API changes, we're changing the project's
+package name from `com.squareup.okhttp` to `okhttp3`. This should make it
+possible for large applications to migrate incrementally. The Maven group ID
+is now `com.squareup.okhttp3`. For an explanation of this strategy, see Jake
+Wharton's post, [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version
+Updates][major_versions].
+
+This release obsoletes OkHttp 2.x, and all code that uses OkHttp's
+`com.squareup.okhttp` package should upgrade to the `okhttp3` package. Libraries
+that depend on OkHttp should upgrade quickly to prevent applications from being
+stuck on the old version.
+
+ *  **There is no longer a global singleton connection pool.** In OkHttp 2.x,
+    all `OkHttpClient` instances shared a common connection pool by default.
+    In OkHttp 3.x, each new `OkHttpClient` gets its own private connection pool.
+    Applications should avoid creating many connection pools as doing so
+    prevents connection reuse. Each connection pool holds its own set of
+    connections alive so applications that have many pools also risk exhausting
+    memory!
+
+    The best practice in OkHttp 3 is to create a single OkHttpClient instance
+    and share it throughout the application. Requests that needs a customized
+    client should call `OkHttpClient.newBuilder()` on that shared instance.
+    This allows customization without the drawbacks of separate connection
+    pools.
+
+ *  **OkHttpClient is now stateless.** In the 2.x API `OkHttpClient` had getters
+    and setters. Internally each request was forced to make its own complete
+    snapshot of the `OkHttpClient` instance to defend against racy configuration
+    changes. In 3.x, `OkHttpClient` is now stateless and has a builder. Note
+    that this class is not strictly immutable as it has stateful members like
+    the connection pool and cache.
+
+ *  **Get and Set prefixes are now avoided.** With ubiquitous builders
+    throughout OkHttp these accessor prefixes aren't necessary. Previously
+    OkHttp used _get_ and _set_ prefixes sporadically which make the API
+    inconsistent and awkward to explore.
+
+ *  **OkHttpClient now implements the new `Call.Factory` interface.** This
+    interface will make your code easier to test. When you test code that makes
+    HTTP requests, you can use this interface to replace the real `OkHttpClient`
+    with your own mocks or fakes.
+
+    The interface will also let you use OkHttp's API with another HTTP client's
+    implementation. This is useful in sandboxed environments like Google App
+    Engine.
+
+ *  **OkHttp now does cookies.** We've replaced `java.net.CookieHandler` with
+    a new interface, `CookieJar` and added our own `Cookie` model class. This
+    new cookie follows the latest RFC and supports the same cookie attributes
+    as modern web browsers.
+
+ *  **Form and Multipart bodies are now modeled.** We've replaced the opaque
+    `FormEncodingBuilder` with the more powerful `FormBody` and
+    `FormBody.Builder` combo. Similarly we've upgraded `MultipartBuilder` into
+    `MultipartBody`, `MultipartBody.Part`, and `MultipartBody.Builder`.
+
+ *  **The Apache HTTP client and HttpURLConnection APIs are deprecated.** They
+    continue to work as they always have, but we're moving everything to the new
+    OkHttp 3 API. The `okhttp-apache` and `okhttp-urlconnection` modules should
+    be only be used to accelerate a transition to OkHttp's request/response API.
+    These deprecated modules will be dropped in an upcoming OkHttp 3.x release.
+
+ *  **Canceling batches of calls is now the application's responsibility.**
+    The API to cancel calls by tag has been removed and replaced with a more
+    general mechanism. The dispatcher now exposes all in-flight calls via its
+    `runningCalls()` and `queuedCalls()` methods. You can write code that
+    selects calls by tag, host, or whatever, and invokes `Call.cancel()` on the
+    ones that are no longer necessary.
+
+ *  **OkHttp no longer uses the global `java.net.Authenticator` by default.**
+    We've changed our `Authenticator` interface to authenticate web and proxy
+    authentication failures through a single method. An adapter for the old
+    authenticator is available in the `okhttp-urlconnection` module.
+
+ *  Fix: Don't throw `IOException` on `ResponseBody.contentLength()` or `close()`.
+ *  Fix: Never throw converting an `HttpUrl` to a `java.net.URI`. This changes
+    the `uri()` method to handle malformed percent-escapes and characters
+    forbidden by `URI`.
+ *  Fix: When a connect times out, attempt an alternate route. Previously route
+    selection was less efficient when differentiating failures.
+ *  New: `Response.peekBody()` lets you access the response body without
+    consuming it. This may be handy for interceptors!
+ *  New: `HttpUrl.newBuilder()` resolves a link to a builder.
+ *  New: Add the TLS version to the `Handshake`.
+ *  New: Drop `Request.uri()` and `Request#urlString()`. Just use
+    `Request.url().uri()` and `Request.url().toString()`.
+ *  New: Add URL to HTTP response logging.
+ *  New: Make `HttpUrl` the blessed URL method of `Request`.

-Change Log
-==========
-
-## Version 5.0.0-alpha.4
-
-_2022-02-01_
-
-**This release introduces fast fallback to better support mixed IPv4+IPv6 networks.** Fast fallback
-is what we're calling our implementation of Happy Eyeballs, [RFC 8305][rfc_8305]. With this
-feature OkHttp will attempt both IPv6 and IPv4 connections concurrently, keeping whichever connects
-first. Fast fallback gives IPv6 connections a 250 ms head start so IPv6 is preferred on networks
-where it's available.
-
-To opt-in, configure your `OkHttpClient.Builder`:
-
-
-```
-OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
-    .fastFallback(true)
-    .build();
-```
-
- *  New: Change the build from Kotlin-JVM to Kotlin-multiplatform (which includes JVM). Both
-    native and JavaScript platforms are unstable preview releases and subject to
-    backwards-incompatible changes in forthcoming releases.
- *  Fix: Don't crash loading the public suffix database resource in obfuscated builds.
- *  Fix: Don't silently ignore calls to `EventSource.cancel()` made from
-    `EventSourceListener.onOpen()`.
- *  Fix: Enforce the max intermediates constraint when using pinned certificates with Conscrypt.
-    This impacts Conscrypt when the server's presented certificates form both a trusted-but-unpinned
-    chain and an untrusted-but-pinned chain.
- *  Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.6.10][kotlin_1_6_10].
-
-
-## Version 5.0.0-alpha.3
-
-_2021-11-22_
-
- *  Fix: Change `Headers.toString()` to redact authorization and cookie headers.
- *  Fix: Don't do DNS to get the hostname for `RecordedRequest.requestUrl`. This was doing a DNS
-    lookup for the local hostname, but we really just wanted the `Host` header.
- *  Fix: Don't crash with a `InaccessibleObjectException` when detecting the platform trust manager
-    on Java 17+.
- *  Fix: Don't crash if a cookie's value is a lone double quote character.
- *  Fix: Don't crash when canceling an event source created by `EventSources.processResponse()`.
- *  New: `Cache` now has a public constructor that takes an [okio.FileSystem]. This should make it
-    possible to implement decorators for cache encryption or compression.
- *  New: `Cookie.newBuilder()` to build upon an existing cookie.
- *  New: Use TLSv1.3 when running on JDK 8u261 or newer.
- *  New: `QueueDispatcher.clear()` may be used to reset a MockWebServer instance.
- *  New: `FileDescriptor.toRequestBody()` may be particularly useful for users of Android's Storage
-    Access Framework.
- *  Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.5.31][kotlin_1_5_31].
- *  Upgrade: [Okio 3.0.0][okio_3_0_0].
-
-
-## Version 5.0.0-alpha.2
-
-_2021-01-30_
-
-**In this release MockWebServer has a new Maven coordinate and package name.** A longstanding
-problem with MockWebServer has been its API dependency on JUnit 4. We've reorganized things to
-remove that dependency while preserving backwards compatibility.
-
-| Maven Coordinate                                         | Package Name          | Description                       |
-| :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
-| com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3:5.0.0-alpha.2        | mockwebserver3        | Core module. No JUnit dependency! |
-| com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit4:5.0.0-alpha.2 | mockwebserver3.junit4 | Optional JUnit 4 integration.     |
-| com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit5:5.0.0-alpha.2 | mockwebserver3.junit5 | Optional JUnit 5 integration.     |
-| com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:5.0.0-alpha.2         | okhttp3.mockwebserver | Obsolete. Depends on JUnit 4.     |
-
-The new APIs use `mockwebserver3` in both the Maven coordinate and package name. This new API is
-**not stable** and will likely change before the final 5.0.0 release.
-
-If you have code that subclasses `okhttp3.mockwebserver.QueueDispatcher`, this update is not source
-or binary compatible. Migrating to the new `mockwebserver3` package will fix this problem.
-
- *  New: DNS over HTTPS is now a stable feature of OkHttp. We introduced this as an experimental
-    module in 2018. We are confident in its stable API and solid implementation.
- *  Fix: Work around a crash in Android 10 and 11 that may be triggered when two threads
-    concurrently close an SSL socket. This would have appeared in crash logs as
-    `NullPointerException: bio == null`.
- *  Fix: Use plus `+` instead of `%20` to encode space characters in `FormBody`. This was a
-    longstanding bug in OkHttp. The fix makes OkHttp consistent with major web browsers.
- *  Fix: Don't crash if Conscrypt returns a null version.
- *  Fix: Include the public suffix data as a resource in GraalVM native images.
- *  Fix: Fail fast when the cache is corrupted.
- *  Fix: Fail fast when a private key cannot be encoded.
- *  Fix: Fail fast when attempting to verify a non-ASCII hostname.
- *  Upgrade: [GraalVM 21][graalvm_21].
- *  Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.4.20][kotlin_1_4_20].
-
-
-## Version 5.0.0-alpha.1
-
-_2021-01-30_
-
-**This release adds initial support for [GraalVM][graalvm].**
-
-GraalVM is an exciting new platform and we're eager to adopt it. The startup time improvements over
-the JVM are particularly impressive. Try it with okcurl:
-
-```
-$ ./gradlew okcurl:nativeImage
-$ ./okcurl/build/graal/okcurl https://cash.app/robots.txt
-```
-
-This is our first release that supports GraalVM. Our code on this platform is less mature than JVM
-and Android! Please report any issues you encounter: we'll fix them urgently.
-
- *  Fix: Attempt to read the response body even if the server canceled the request. This will cause
-    some calls to return nice error codes like `HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests` instead of transport
-    errors like `SocketException: Connection reset` and `StreamResetException: stream was reset:
-    CANCEL`.
- *  New: Support OSGi metadata.
- *  Upgrade: [Okio 2.9.0][okio_2_9_0].
-
-    ```kotlin
-    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:2.9.0")
-    ```
-
-Note that this was originally released on 2020-10-06 as 4.10.0-RC1. The only change from that
-release is the version name.

-OkHttp 4.x Change Log
-=====================
-
-## Version 4.9.3
-
-_2021-11-21_
-
- *  Fix: Don't fail HTTP/2 responses if they complete before a `RST_STREAM` is sent.
-
-
-## Version 4.9.2
-
-_2021-09-30_
-
- *  Fix: Don't include potentially-sensitive header values in `Headers.toString()` or exceptions.
-    This applies to `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`, and `Set-Cookie` headers.
- *  Fix: Don't crash with an `InaccessibleObjectException` when running on JDK17+ with strong
-    encapsulation enabled.
- *  Fix: Strictly verify hostnames used with OkHttp's `HostnameVerifier`. Programs that make direct
-    manual calls to `HostnameVerifier` could be defeated if the hostnames they pass in are not
-    strictly ASCII. This issue is tracked as [CVE-2021-0341].
-
-
-## Version 4.9.1
-
-_2021-01-30_
-
- *  Fix: Work around a crash in Android 10 and 11 that may be triggered when two threads
-    concurrently close an SSL socket. This would have appeared in crash logs as
-    `NullPointerException: bio == null`.
-
-
-## Version 4.9.0
-
-_2020-09-11_
-
-**With this release, `okhttp-tls` no longer depends on Bouncy Castle and doesn't install the
-Bouncy Castle security provider.** If you still need it, you can do it yourself:
-
-```
-Security.addProvider(BouncyCastleProvider())
-```
-
-You will also need to configure this dependency:
-
-```
-dependencies {
-  implementation "org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.65"
-}
-```
-
- *  Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.4.10][kotlin_1_4_10]. We now use Kotlin 1.4.x [functional
-    interfaces][fun_interface] for `Authenticator`, `Interceptor`, and others.
- *  Upgrade: Build with Conscrypt 2.5.1.
-
-
-## Version 4.8.1
-
-_2020-08-06_
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash in `HeldCertificate.Builder` when creating certificates on older versions of
-    Android, including Android 6. We were using a feature of `SimpleDateFormat` that wasn't
-    available in those versions!
-
-
-## Version 4.8.0
-
-_2020-07-11_
-
- *  New: Change `HeldCertificate.Builder` to use its own ASN.1 certificate encoder. This is part
-    of our effort to remove the okhttp-tls module's dependency on Bouncy Castle. We think Bouncy
-    Castle is great! But it's a large dependency (6.5 MiB) and its security provider feature
-    impacts VM-wide behavior.
-
- *  New: Reduce contention for applications that make a very high number of concurrent requests.
-    Previously OkHttp used its connection pool as a lock when making changes to connections and
-    calls. With this change each connection is locked independently.
-
- *  Upgrade: [Okio 2.7.0][okio_2_7_0].
-
-    ```kotlin
-    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:2.7.0")
-    ```
-
- *  Fix: Avoid log messages like "Didn't find class org.conscrypt.ConscryptHostnameVerifier" when
-    detecting the TLS capabilities of the host platform.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash in `HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain()` when the hostname is malformed.
-
- *  Fix: Don't attempt Brotli decompression if the response body is empty.
-
-
-## Version 4.7.2
-
-_2020-05-20_
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash inspecting whether the host platform is JVM or Android. With 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 we
-    had a crash `IllegalArgumentException: Not a Conscrypt trust manager` because we depended on
-    initialization order of companion objects.
-
-
-## Version 4.7.1
-
-_2020-05-18_
-
- *  Fix: Pass the right arguments in the trust manager created for `addInsecureHost()`. Without the
-    fix insecure hosts crash with an `IllegalArgumentException` on Android.
-
-
-## Version 4.7.0
-
-_2020-05-17_
-
- *  New: `HandshakeCertificates.Builder.addInsecureHost()` makes it easy to turn off security in
-    private development environments that only carry test data. Prefer this over creating an
-    all-trusting `TrustManager` because only hosts on the allowlist are insecure. From
-    [our DevServer sample][dev_server]:
-
-    ```kotlin
-    val clientCertificates = HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-        .addPlatformTrustedCertificates()
-        .addInsecureHost("localhost")
-        .build()
-
-    val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
-        .sslSocketFactory(clientCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), clientCertificates.trustManager)
-        .build()
-    ```
-
- *  New: Add `cacheHit`, `cacheMiss`, and `cacheConditionalHit()` events to `EventListener`. Use
-    these in logs, metrics, and even test cases to confirm your cache headers are configured as
-    expected.
-
- *  New: Constant string `okhttp3.VERSION`. This is a string like "4.5.0-RC1", "4.5.0", or
-    "4.6.0-SNAPSHOT" indicating the version of OkHttp in the current runtime. Use this to include
-    the OkHttp version in custom `User-Agent` headers.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable
-    platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it's running in a JVM or in Android.
-    The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp!
-
- *  Fix: Include the header `Accept: text/event-stream` for SSE calls. This header is not added if
-    the request already contains an `Accept` header.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash with a `NullPointerException` if a server sends a close while we're sending a
-    ping. OkHttp had a race condition bug.
-
-
-## Version 4.6.0
-
-_2020-04-28_
-
- *  Fix: Follow HTTP 307 and 308 redirects on methods other than GET and POST. We're reluctant to
-    change OkHttp's behavior in handling common HTTP status codes, but this fix is overdue! The new
-    behavior is now consistent with [RFC 7231][rfc_7231_647], which is newer than OkHttp itself.
-    If you want this update with the old behavior use [this interceptor][legacy_interceptor].
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash decompressing web sockets messages. We had a bug where we assumed deflated
-    bytes in would always yield deflated bytes out and this isn't always the case!
-
- *  Fix: Reliably update and invalidate the disk cache on windows. As originally designed our
-    internal `DiskLruCache` assumes an inode-like file system, where it's fine to delete files that
-    are currently being read or written. On Windows the file system forbids this so we must be more
-    careful when deleting and renaming files.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and
-    above. See [Jetty's overview][jetty_8_252] of the API change and its consequences.
-
- *  New: `MultipartReader` is a streaming decoder for [MIME multipart (RFC 2045)][rfc_2045]
-    messages. It complements `MultipartBody` which is our streaming encoder.
-
-    ```kotlin
-    val response: Response = call.execute()
-    val multipartReader = MultipartReader(response.body!!)
-
-    multipartReader.use {
-      while (true) {
-        val part = multipartReader.nextPart() ?: break
-        process(part.headers, part.body)
-      }
-    }
-    ```
-
- *  New: `MediaType.parameter()` gets a parameter like `boundary` from a media type like
-    `multipart/mixed; boundary="abc"`.
-
- *  New: `Authenticator.JAVA_NET_AUTHENTICATOR` forwards authentication requests to
-    `java.net.Authenticator`. This obsoletes `JavaNetAuthenticator` in the `okhttp-urlconnection`
-    module.
-
- *  New: `CertificatePinner` now offers an API for inspecting the configured pins.
-
- *  Upgrade: [Okio 2.6.0][okio_2_6_0].
-
-    ```kotlin
-    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:2.6.0")
-    ```
-
- *  Upgrade: [publicsuffix.org data][public_suffix]. This powers `HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain()`.
-    It's also how OkHttp knows which domains can share cookies with one another.
-
- *  Upgrade: [Bouncy Castle 1.65][bouncy_castle_releases]. This dependency is required by the
-    `okhttp-tls` module.
-
- *  Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.3.71][kotlin_1_3_71].
-
-
-## Version 4.5.0
-
-_2020-04-06_
-
-**This release fixes a severe bug where OkHttp incorrectly detected and recovered from unhealthy
-connections.** Stale or canceled connections were incorrectly attempted when they shouldn't have
-been, leading to rare cases of infinite retries. Please upgrade to this release!
-
- *  Fix: don't return stale DNS entries in `DnsOverHttps`. We were caching DNS results indefinitely
-    rather than the duration specified in the response's cache-control header.
- *  Fix: Verify certificate IP addresses in canonical form. When a server presents a TLS certificate
-    containing an IP address we must match that address against the URL's IP address, even when the
-    two addresses are encoded differently, such as `192.168.1.1` and `0::0:0:FFFF:C0A8:101`. Note
-    that OkHttp incorrectly rejected valid certificates resulting in a failure to connect; at no
-    point were invalid certificates accepted.
- *  New: `OkHttpClient.Builder.minWebSocketMessageToCompress()` configures a threshold for
-    compressing outbound web socket messages. Configure this with 0L to always compress outbound
-    messages and `Long.MAX_VALUE` to never compress outbound messages. The default is 1024L which
-    compresses messages of size 1 KiB and larger. (Inbound messages are compressed or not based on
-    the web socket server's configuration.)
- *  New: Defer constructing `Inflater` and `Deflater` instances until they are needed. This saves
-    memory if web socket compression is negotiated but not used.
-
-
-## Version 4.5.0-RC1
-
-_2020-03-17_
-
-**This release candidate turns on web socket compression.**
-
-The [spec][rfc_7692] includes a sophisticated mechanism for client and server to negotiate
-compression features. We strive to offer great performance in our default configuration and so we're
-making compression the default for everyone starting with this release candidate.
-
-Please be considerate of your servers and their operators as you roll out this release. Compression
-saves bandwidth but it costs CPU and memory! If you run into a problem you may need to adjust or
-disable the `permessage-deflate` compression settings on your server.
-
-Note that OkHttp won't use compression when sending messages smaller than 1 KiB.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash when the URL hostname contains an underscore on Android.
- *  Fix: Change HTTP/2 to use a daemon thread for its socket reader. If you've ever seen a command
-    line application hang after all of the work is done, it may be due to a non-daemon thread like
-    this one.
- *  New: Include suppressed exceptions when all routes to a target service fail.
-
-
-## Version 4.4.1
-
-_2020-03-08_
-
- *  Fix: Don't reuse a connection on redirect if certs match but DNS does not. For better
-    locality and performance OkHttp attempts to use the same pooled connection across redirects and
-    follow-ups. It independently shares connections when the IP addresses and certificates match,
-    even if the host names do not. In 4.4.0 we introduced a regression where we shared a connection
-    when certificates matched but the DNS addresses did not. This would only occur when following a
-    redirect from one hostname to another, and where both hosts had common certificates.
-
- *  Fix: Don't fail on a redirect when a client has configured a 'trust everything' trust manager.
-    Typically this would cause certain redirects to fail in debug and development configurations.
-
-
-## Version 4.4.0
-
-_2020-02-17_
-
- *  New: Support `canceled()` as an event that can be observed by `EventListener`. This should be
-    useful for splitting out canceled calls in metrics.
-
- *  New: Publish a [bill of materials (BOM)][bom] for OkHttp. Depend on this from Gradle or Maven to
-    keep all of your OkHttp artifacts on the same version, even if they're declared via transitive
-    dependencies. You can even omit versions when declaring other OkHttp dependencies.
-
-    ```kotlin
-    dependencies {
-       api(platform("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-bom:4.4.0"))
-       api("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp")              // No version!
-       api("com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor") // No version!
-    }
-    ```
-
- *  New: Upgrade to Okio 2.4.3.
-
-    ```kotlin
-    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:2.4.3")
-    ```
-
- *  Fix: Limit retry attempts for HTTP/2 `REFUSED_STREAM` and `CANCEL` failures.
- *  Fix: Retry automatically when incorrectly sharing a connection among multiple hostnames. OkHttp
-    shares connections when hosts share both IP addresses and certificates, such as `squareup.com`
-    and `www.squareup.com`. If a server refuses such sharing it will return HTTP 421 and OkHttp will
-    automatically retry on an unshared connection.
- *  Fix: Don't crash if a TLS tunnel's response body is truncated.
- *  Fix: Don't track unusable routes beyond their usefulness. We had a bug where we could track
-    certain bad routes indefinitely; now we only track the ones that could be necessary.
- *  Fix: Defer proxy selection until a proxy is required. This saves calls to `ProxySelector` on
-    calls that use a pooled connection.
-
-
-## Version 4.3.1
-
-_2020-01-07_
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash with a `NullPointerException` when a web socket is closed before it connects.
-    This regression was introduced in OkHttp 4.3.0.
- *  Fix: Don't crash with an `IllegalArgumentException` when using custom trust managers on
-    Android 10. Android uses reflection to look up a magic `checkServerTrusted()` method and we
-    didn't have it.
- *  Fix: Explicitly specify the remote server name when making HTTPS connections on Android 5. In
-    4.3.0 we introduced a regression where server name indication (SNI) was broken on Android 5.
-
-
-## Version 4.3.0
-
-_2019-12-31_
-
- *  Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact
-    the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after
-    a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling.
-
- *  Fix: Don't call `EventListener.responseHeadersStart()` or `responseBodyStart()` until bytes have
-    been received. Previously these events were incorrectly sent too early, when OkHttp was ready to
-    read the response headers or body, which mislead tracing tools. Note that the `responseFailed()`
-    event always used to follow one of these events; now it may be sent without them.
-
- *  New: Upgrade to Kotlin 1.3.61.
-
- *  New: Match any number of subdomains with two asterisks in `CertificatePinner`. For example,
-    `**.squareup.com` matches `us-west.www.squareup.com`, `www.squareup.com` and `squareup.com`.
-
- *  New: Share threads more aggressively between OkHttp's HTTP/2 connections, connection pool,
-    web sockets, and cache. OkHttp has a new internal task runner abstraction for managed task
-    scheduling. In your debugger you will see new thread names and more use of daemon threads.
-
- *  Fix: Don't drop callbacks on unexpected exceptions. When an interceptor throws an unchecked
-    exception the callback is now notified that the call was canceled. The exception is still sent
-    to the uncaught exception handler for reporting and recovery.
-
- *  Fix: Un-deprecate `MockResponse.setHeaders()` and other setters. These were deprecated in OkHttp
-    4.0 but that broke method chaining for Java callers.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash on HTTP/2 HEAD requests when the `Content-Length` header is present but is not
-    consistent with the length of the response body.
-
- *  Fix: Don't crash when converting a `HttpUrl` instance with an unresolvable hostname to a URI.
-    The new behavior strips invalid characters like `"` and `{` from the hostname before converting.
-
- *  Fix: Undo a performance regression introduced in OkHttp 4.0 caused by differences in behavior
-    between Kotlin's `assert()` and Java's `assert()`. (Kotlin always evaluates the argument; Java
-    only does when assertions are enabled.)
-
- *  Fix: Honor `RequestBody.isOneShot()` in `HttpLoggingInterceptor`.
-
-
-## Version 4.2.2
-
-_2019-10-06_
-
- *  Fix: When closing a canceled HTTP/2 stream, don't send the `END_STREAM` flag. This could cause
-    the server to incorrectly interpret the stream as having completed normally. This is most useful
-    when a request body needs to cancel its own call.
-
-
-## Version 4.2.1
-
-_2019-10-02_
-
- *  Fix: In 4.1.0 we introduced a performance regression that prevented connections from being
-    pooled in certain situations. We have good test coverage for connection pooling but we missed
-    this because it only occurs if you have proxy configured and you share a connection pool among
-    multiple `OkHttpClient` instances.
-
-    This particularly-subtle bug was caused by us assigning each `OkHttpClient` instance its own
-    `NullProxySelector` when an explicit proxy is configured. But we don't share connections when
-    the proxy selectors are different. Ugh!
-
-
-## Version 4.2.0
-
-_2019-09-10_
-
- *  New: API to decode a certificate and private key to create a `HeldCertificate`. This accepts a
-    string containing both a certificate and PKCS #8-encoded private key.
-
-    ```kotlin
-    val heldCertificate = HeldCertificate.decode("""
-        |-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
-        |MIIBYTCCAQegAwIBAgIBKjAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjApMRQwEgYDVQQLEwtlbmdpbmVl

-    val handshakeCertificates = HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-        .heldCertificate(heldCertificate)
-        .build()
-    val server = MockWebServer()
-    server.useHttps(handshakeCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), false)
-    ```
-
-    Get these strings with `HeldCertificate.certificatePem()` and `privateKeyPkcs8Pem()`.
-
- *  Fix: Handshake now returns peer certificates in canonical order: each certificate is signed by
-    the certificate that follows and the last certificate is signed by a trusted root.
-
- *  Fix: Don't lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this
-    happened enough then eventually the connection would stall.
-
- *  Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we
-    could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to
-    fail the call.
-
-
-## Version 4.1.1
-
-_2019-09-05_
-
- *  Fix: Don't drop repeated headers when validating cached responses. In our Kotlin upgrade we
-    introduced a regression where we iterated the number of unique header names rather than then
-    number of unique headers. If you're using OkHttp's response cache this may impact you.
-
-
-## Version 4.1.0
-
-_2019-08-12_
-
- [brotli]: https://github.com/google/brotli
-
- *  **OkHttp's new okhttp-brotli module implements Brotli compression.** Install the interceptor to
-    enable [Brotli compression][brotli], which compresses 5-20% smaller than gzip.
-
-    ```
-    val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
-        .addInterceptor(BrotliInterceptor)
-        .build()
-    ```
-
-    This artifact has a dependency on Google's Brotli decoder (95 KiB).
-
- *  New: `EventListener.proxySelectStart()`, `proxySelectEnd()` events give visibility into the
-    proxy selection process.
- *  New: `Response.byteString()` reads the entire response into memory as a byte string.
- *  New: `OkHttpClient.x509TrustManager` accessor.
- *  New: Permit [new WebSocket response codes][iana_websocket]: 1012 (Service Restart), 1013 (Try
-    Again Later), and 1014 (invalid response from the upstream).
- *  New: Build with Kotlin 1.3.41, BouncyCastle 1.62, and Conscrypt 2.2.1.
- *  Fix: Recover gracefully when a coalesced connection immediately goes unhealthy.
- *  Fix: Defer the `SecurityException` when looking up the default proxy selector.
- *  Fix: Don't use brackets formatting IPv6 host names in MockWebServer.
- *  Fix: Don't permit cache iterators to remove entries that are being written.
-
-
-## Version 4.0.1
-
-_2019-07-10_
-
- *  Fix: Tolerate null-hostile lists in public API. Lists created with `List.of(...)` don't like it
-    when you call `contains(null)` on them!
- *  Fix: Retain binary-compatibility in `okhttp3.internal.HttpHeaders.hasBody()`. Some unscrupulous
-    coders call this and we don't want their users to suffer.
-
-
-## Version 4.0.0
-
-_2019-06-26_
-
-**This release upgrades OkHttp to Kotlin.** We tried our best to make fast and safe to upgrade
-from OkHttp 3.x. We wrote an [upgrade guide][upgrading_to_okhttp_4] to help with the migration and a
-[blog post][okhttp4_blog_post] to explain it.
-
- *  Fix: Target Java 8 bytecode for Java and Kotlin.
-
-
-## Version 4.0.0-RC3
-
-_2019-06-24_
-
- *  Fix: Retain binary-compatibility in `okhttp3.internal.HttpMethod`. Naughty third party SDKs
-    import this and we want to ease upgrades for their users.
-
-
-## Version 4.0.0-RC2
-
-_2019-06-21_
-
- *  New: Require Kotlin 1.3.40.
- *  New: Change the Kotlin API from `File.toRequestBody()` to `File.asRequestBody()` and
-    `BufferedSource.toResponseBody()` to `BufferedSource.asResponseBody()`. If the returned value
-    is a view of what created it, we use _as_.
- *  Fix: Permit response codes of zero for compatibility with OkHttp 3.x.
- *  Fix: Change the return type of `MockWebServer.takeRequest()` to be nullable.
- *  Fix: Make `Call.clone()` public to Kotlin callers.
-
-
-## Version 4.0.0-RC1
-
-_2019-06-03_

+Open Source Code of Conduct
+===========================
+
+At Square, we are committed to contributing to the open source community and simplifying the process
+of releasing and managing open source software. We’ve seen incredible support and enthusiasm from
+thousands of people who have already contributed to our projects — and we want to ensure our community
+continues to be truly open for everyone.
+
+This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as steps to reporting
+unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and
+expect our code of conduct to be honored.
+
+Square’s open source community strives to:
+
+ * **Be open**: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is
+   open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the required
+   capacity and competence.
+
+ * **Be considerate**: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and
+   colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and
+   documentation may negatively impact others.
+
+ * **Be respectful**: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions,
+   and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.
+
+ * **Be collaborative**: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We
+   strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream
+   developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.
+
+ * **Be pragmatic**: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid
+   problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your
+   questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.
+
+ * **Step down considerately**: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or
+   disengages from the project, they should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that
+   others can pick up where they left off.
+
+This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a
+collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in
+the letter.
+
+Diversity Statement
+-------------------
+
+We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we
+may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal.
+
+Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone
+has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
+our best to right the wrong.
+
+Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, culture, ethnicity,
+gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race,
+religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate
+discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
+disabilities.
+
+Reporting Issues
+----------------
+
+If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior — or have any other concerns — please report it by
+emailing [codeofconduct@squareup.com][codeofconduct_at]. For more details, please see our Reporting
+Guidelines below.

+Concurrency
+===========
+
+This document describes the concurrency considerations for http/2 connections and the connection pool within OkHttp.
+
+## HTTP/2 Connections
+
+The HttpURLConnection API is a blocking API. You make a blocking write to send a request, and a blocking read to receive the response.
+
+#### Blocking APIs
+
+Blocking APIs are convenient because you get top-to-bottom procedural code without indirection. Network calls work like regular method calls: ask for data and it is returned. If the request fails, you get a stacktrace right where the call was made.
+
+Blocking APIs may be inefficient because you hold a thread idle while waiting on the network. Threads are expensive because they have both a memory overhead and a context-switching overhead.
+
+#### Framed protocols
+
+Framed protocols like http/2 don't lend themselves to blocking APIs. Each application-layer thread wants to do blocking I/O for a specific stream, but the streams are multiplexed on the socket. You can't just talk to the socket, you need to cooperate with the other application-layer threads that you're sharing it with.
+
+Framing rules make it impractical to implement http/2 correctly on a single blocking thread. The flow-control features introduce feedback between reads and writes, requiring writes to acknowledge reads and reads to throttle writes.
+
+In OkHttp we expose a blocking API over a framed protocol. This document explains the code and policy that makes that work.
+
+### Threads
+
+#### Application's calling thread
+
+The application-layer must block on writing I/O. We can't return from a write until we've pushed its bytes onto the socket. Otherwise, if the write fails we are unable to deliver its IOException to the application. We would have told the application layer that the write succeeded, but it didn't!
+
+The application-layer can also do blocking reads. If the application asks to read and there's nothing available, we need to hold that thread until either the bytes arrive, the stream is closed, or a timeout elapses. If we get bytes but there's nobody asking for them, we buffer them. We don't consider bytes as delivered for flow control until they're consumed by the application.
+
+Consider an application streaming a video over http/2. Perhaps the user pauses the video and the application stops reading bytes from this stream. The buffer will fill up, and flow control prevents the server from sending more data on this stream. When the user unpauses her video the buffer drains, the read is acknowledged, and the server proceeds to stream data.
+
+#### Shared reader thread
+
+We can't rely on application threads to read data from the socket. Application threads are transient: sometimes they're reading and writing and sometimes they're off doing application-layer things. But the socket is permanent, and it needs constant attention: we dispatch all incoming frames so the connection is good-to-go when the application layer needs it.
+
+So we have a dedicated thread for every socket that just reads frames and dispatches them.
+
+The reader thread must never run application-layer code. Otherwise one slow stream can hold up the entire connection.
+
+Similarly, the reader thread must never block on writing because this can deadlock the connection. Consider a client and server that both violate this rule. If you get unlucky, they could fill up their TCP buffers (so that writes block) and then use their reader threads to write a frame. Nobody is reading on either end, and the buffers are never drained.
+
+#### Do-stuff-later pool
+
+Sometimes there's an action required like calling the application layer or responding to a ping, and the thread discovering the action is not the thread that should do the work. We enqueue a runnable on this executor and it gets handled by one of the executor's threads.
+
+### Locks
+
+We have 3 different things that we synchronize on.
+
+#### Http2Connection
+
+This lock guards internal state of each connection. This lock is never held for blocking operations. That means that we acquire the lock, read or write a few fields and release the lock. No I/O and no application-layer callbacks.
+
+#### Http2Stream
+
+This lock guards the internal state of each stream. As above, it is never held for blocking operations. When we need to hold an application thread to block a read, we use wait/notify on this lock. This works because the lock is released while `wait()` is waiting.
+
+#### Http2Writer
+
+Socket writes are guarded by the Http2Writer. Only one stream can write at a time so that messages are not interleaved. Writes are either made by application-layer threads or the do-stuff-later pool.
+
+### Holding multiple locks
+
+You're allowed to take the Http2Connection lock while holding the Http2Writer lock. But not vice-versa. Because taking the Http2Writer lock can block.
+
+This is necessary for bookkeeping when creating new streams. Correct framing requires that stream IDs are sequential on the socket, so we need to bundle assigning the ID with sending the `SYN_STREAM` frame.
+
+## Connection Pool
+
+A primary responsibility for any HTTP client is to efficiently manage network connections. Creating and establishing new connections require a fair amount of overhead and added latency. OkHttp will make every effort to reuse existing connections to avoid this overhead and added latency.
+
+Every OkHttpClient uses a connection pool. Its job is to maintain a reference to all open connections. When an HTTP request is started, OkHttp will attempt to reuse an existing connection from the pool. If there are no existing connections, a new one is created and put into the connection pool. For HTTP/2, the connection can be reused immediately. For HTTP/1, the request must be completed before it can be reused.
+
+Since HTTP requests frequently happen in parallel, connection pooling must be thread-safe.
+
+These are the primary classes involved with establishing, sharing, and terminating connections:
+
+ * **RealConnectionPool** manages reuse of HTTP and HTTP/2 connections for reduced latency. Every OkHttpClient has one, and its lifetime spans the lifetime of the OkHttpClient.
+
+ * **RealConnection** is the socket and streams of an HTTP/1 or HTTP/2 connection. These are created on demand to fulfill HTTP requests. They may be reused for many HTTP request/response exchanges. Their lifetime is typically shorter than a connection pool.
+
+ * **Exchange** carries a single HTTP request/response pair.
+
+ * **ExchangeFinder** chooses which connection carries each exchange. Where possible it will use the same connection for all exchanges in a single call. It prefers reusing pooled connections over establishing new connections.      
+
+#### Per-Connection Locks
+
+Each connection has its own lock. The connections in the pool are all in a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. Due to data races, iterators of this queue may return removed connections. Callers must check the connection's `noNewExchanges` property before using connections from the pool.
+
+The connection lock is never held while doing I/O (even closing a socket) to prevent contention.
+
+A lock-per-connection is used to maximize concurrency.

+Connections
+===========
+
+Although you provide only the URL, OkHttp plans its connection to your webserver using three types: URL, Address, and Route.
+
+### [URLs](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-http-url/)
+
+URLs (like `https://github.com/square/okhttp`) are fundamental to HTTP and the Internet. In addition to being a universal, decentralized naming scheme for everything on the web, they also specify how to access web resources.
+
+URLs are abstract:
+
+ * They specify that the call may be plaintext (`http`) or encrypted (`https`), but not which cryptographic algorithms should be used. Nor do they specify how to verify the peer's certificates (the [HostnameVerifier](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html)) or which certificates can be trusted (the [SSLSocketFactory](https://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html)).
+ * They don't specify whether a specific proxy server should be used or how to authenticate with that proxy server.
+
+They're also concrete: each URL identifies a specific path (like `/square/okhttp`) and query (like `?q=sharks&lang=en`). Each webserver hosts many URLs.
+
+### [Addresses](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-address/)
+
+Addresses specify a webserver (like `github.com`) and all of the **static** configuration necessary to connect to that server: the port number, HTTPS settings, and preferred network protocols (like HTTP/2 or SPDY).
+
+URLs that share the same address may also share the same underlying TCP socket connection. Sharing a connection has substantial performance benefits: lower latency, higher throughput (due to [TCP slow start](https://www.igvita.com/2011/10/20/faster-web-vs-tcp-slow-start/)) and conserved battery. OkHttp uses a [ConnectionPool](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-connection-pool/) that automatically reuses HTTP/1.x connections and multiplexes HTTP/2 and SPDY connections.
+
+In OkHttp some fields of the address come from the URL (scheme, hostname, port) and the rest come from the [OkHttpClient](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/).
+
+### [Routes](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-route/)
+
+Routes supply the **dynamic** information necessary to actually connect to a webserver. This is the specific IP address to attempt (as discovered by a DNS query), the exact proxy server to use (if a [ProxySelector](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/ProxySelector.html) is in use), and which version of TLS to negotiate (for HTTPS connections).
+
+There may be many routes for a single address. For example, a webserver that is hosted in multiple datacenters may yield multiple IP addresses in its DNS response.
+
+### [Connections](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-connection/)
+
+When you request a URL with OkHttp, here's what it does:
+
+ 1. It uses the URL and configured OkHttpClient to create an **address**. This address specifies how we'll connect to the webserver.
+ 2. It attempts to retrieve a connection with that address from the **connection pool**.
+ 3. If it doesn't find a connection in the pool, it selects a **route** to attempt. This usually means making a DNS request to get the server's IP addresses. It then selects a TLS version and proxy server if necessary.
+ 4. If it's a new route, it connects by building either a direct socket connection, a TLS tunnel (for HTTPS over an HTTP proxy), or a direct TLS connection. It does TLS handshakes as necessary.
+ 5. It sends the HTTP request and reads the response.
+
+If there's a problem with the connection, OkHttp will select another route and try again. This allows OkHttp to recover when a subset of a server's addresses are unreachable. It's also useful when a pooled connection is stale or if the attempted TLS version is unsupported.
+
+Once the response has been received, the connection will be returned to the pool so it can be reused for a future request. Connections are evicted from the pool after a period of inactivity.

+Debug Logging
+=============
+
+OkHttp has internal APIs to enable debug logging. It uses the `java.util.logging` API which can be
+tricky to configure. As a shortcut, you can paste [OkHttpDebugLogging.kt]. Then enable debug logging
+for whichever features you need:
+
+```
+OkHttpDebugLogging.enableHttp2()
+OkHttpDebugLogging.enableTaskRunner()
+```
+
+### Activating on Android
+
+```
+$ adb shell setprop log.tag.okhttp.Http2 DEBUG
+$ adb shell setprop log.tag.okhttp.TaskRunner DEBUG
+$ adb logcat '*:E' 'okhttp.Http2:D' 'okhttp.TaskRunner:D'
+```
+
+### HTTP/2 Frame Logging
+
+This logs inbound (`<<`) and outbound (`>>`) frames for HTTP/2 connections.
+
+```

+Events
+======
+
+Events allow you to capture metrics on your application’s HTTP calls. Use events to monitor:
+
+ * The size and frequency of the HTTP calls your application makes. If you’re making too many calls, or your calls are too large, you should know about it!
+ * The performance of these calls on the underlying network. If the network’s performance isn’t sufficient, you need to either improve the network or use less of it.
+
+### EventListener
+
+Subclass [EventListener](https://square.github.io/okhttp/3.x/okhttp/okhttp3/EventListener.html) and override methods for the events you are interested in. In a successful HTTP call with no redirects or retries the sequence of events is described by this flow.
+
+![Events Diagram](images/events@2x.png)
+
+Here’s a [sample event listener](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/samples/guide/src/main/java/okhttp3/recipes/PrintEventsNonConcurrent.java) that prints each event with a timestamp.
+
+```java
+class PrintingEventListener extends EventListener {
+  private long callStartNanos;
+
+  private void printEvent(String name) {
+    long nowNanos = System.nanoTime();
+    if (name.equals("callStart")) {
+      callStartNanos = nowNanos;
+    }
+    long elapsedNanos = nowNanos - callStartNanos;
+    System.out.printf("%.3f %s%n", elapsedNanos / 1000000000d, name);
+  }
+
+  @Override public void callStart(Call call) {
+    printEvent("callStart");
+  }
+
+  @Override public void callEnd(Call call) {
+    printEvent("callEnd");
+  }
+
+  @Override public void dnsStart(Call call, String domainName) {
+    printEvent("dnsStart");
+  }
+
+  @Override public void dnsEnd(Call call, String domainName, List<InetAddress> inetAddressList) {
+    printEvent("dnsEnd");
+  }
+
+  ...
+}
+```
+
+We make a couple calls:
+
+```java
+Request request = new Request.Builder()
+    .url("https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
+    .build();
+
+System.out.println("REQUEST 1 (new connection)");
+try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
+  // Consume and discard the response body.
+  response.body().source().readByteString();
+}
+
+System.out.println("REQUEST 2 (pooled connection)");
+try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
+  // Consume and discard the response body.
+  response.body().source().readByteString();
+}
+```
+
+And the listener prints the corresponding events:
+
+```
+REQUEST 1 (new connection)
+0.000 callStart
+0.010 dnsStart
+0.017 dnsEnd
+0.025 connectStart
+0.117 secureConnectStart
+0.586 secureConnectEnd
+0.586 connectEnd
+0.587 connectionAcquired
+0.588 requestHeadersStart
+0.590 requestHeadersEnd
+0.591 responseHeadersStart
+0.675 responseHeadersEnd
+0.676 responseBodyStart
+0.679 responseBodyEnd
+0.679 connectionReleased
+0.680 callEnd
+REQUEST 2 (pooled connection)
+0.000 callStart
+0.001 connectionAcquired
+0.001 requestHeadersStart
+0.001 requestHeadersEnd
+0.002 responseHeadersStart
+0.082 responseHeadersEnd
+0.082 responseBodyStart
+0.082 responseBodyEnd
+0.083 connectionReleased
+0.083 callEnd
+```
+
+Notice how no connect events are fired for the second call. It reused the connection from the first request for dramatically better performance.
+
+### EventListener.Factory
+
+In the preceding example we used a field, `callStartNanos`, to track the elapsed time of each event. This is handy, but it won’t work if multiple calls are executing concurrently. To accommodate this, use a `Factory` to create a new `EventListener` instance for each `Call`. This allows each listener to keep call-specific state.
+
+This [sample factory](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/samples/guide/src/main/java/okhttp3/recipes/PrintEvents.java) creates a unique ID for each call and uses that ID to differentiate calls in log messages.
+
+```java
+class PrintingEventListener extends EventListener {
+  public static final Factory FACTORY = new Factory() {
+    final AtomicLong nextCallId = new AtomicLong(1L);
+
+    @Override public EventListener create(Call call) {
+      long callId = nextCallId.getAndIncrement();
+      System.out.printf("%04d %s%n", callId, call.request().url());
+      return new PrintingEventListener(callId, System.nanoTime());
+    }
+  };
+
+  final long callId;
+  final long callStartNanos;
+
+  public PrintingEventListener(long callId, long callStartNanos) {
+    this.callId = callId;
+    this.callStartNanos = callStartNanos;
+  }
+
+  private void printEvent(String name) {
+    long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - callStartNanos;
+    System.out.printf("%04d %.3f %s%n", callId, elapsedNanos / 1000000000d, name);
+  }
+
+  @Override public void callStart(Call call) {
+    printEvent("callStart");
+  }
+
+  @Override public void callEnd(Call call) {
+    printEvent("callEnd");
+  }
+
+  ...
+}
+```
+
+We can use this listener to race a pair of concurrent HTTP requests:
+
+```java
+Request washingtonPostRequest = new Request.Builder()
+    .url("https://www.washingtonpost.com/")
+    .build();
+client.newCall(washingtonPostRequest).enqueue(new Callback() {
+  ...
+});
+
+Request newYorkTimesRequest = new Request.Builder()
+    .url("https://www.nytimes.com/")
+    .build();
+client.newCall(newYorkTimesRequest).enqueue(new Callback() {
+  ...
+});
+```
+
+Running this race over home WiFi shows the Times (`0002`) completes just slightly sooner than the Post (`0001`):
+
+```
+0001 https://www.washingtonpost.com/
+0001 0.000 callStart
+0002 https://www.nytimes.com/
+0002 0.000 callStart
+0002 0.010 dnsStart
+0001 0.013 dnsStart
+0001 0.022 dnsEnd
+0002 0.019 dnsEnd
+0001 0.028 connectStart
+0002 0.025 connectStart
+0002 0.072 secureConnectStart
+0001 0.075 secureConnectStart
+0001 0.386 secureConnectEnd
+0002 0.390 secureConnectEnd
+0002 0.400 connectEnd
+0001 0.403 connectEnd
+0002 0.401 connectionAcquired
+0001 0.404 connectionAcquired
+0001 0.406 requestHeadersStart
+0002 0.403 requestHeadersStart
+0001 0.414 requestHeadersEnd
+0002 0.411 requestHeadersEnd
+0002 0.412 responseHeadersStart
+0001 0.415 responseHeadersStart
+0002 0.474 responseHeadersEnd
+0002 0.475 responseBodyStart
+0001 0.554 responseHeadersEnd
+0001 0.555 responseBodyStart
+0002 0.554 responseBodyEnd
+0002 0.554 connectionReleased
+0002 0.554 callEnd
+0001 0.624 responseBodyEnd
+0001 0.624 connectionReleased
+0001 0.624 callEnd
+```
+
+The `EventListener.Factory` also makes it possible to limit metrics to a subset of calls. This one captures metrics on a random 10%:
+
+```java
+class MetricsEventListener extends EventListener {
+  private static final Factory FACTORY = new Factory() {
+    @Override public EventListener create(Call call) {
+      if (Math.random() < 0.10) {
+        return new MetricsEventListener(call);
+      } else {
+        return EventListener.NONE;
+      }
+    }
+  };
+
+  ...
+}
+```
+
+### Events with Failures
+
+When an operation fails, a failure method is called. This is `connectFailed()` for failures while building a connection to the server, and `callFailed()` when the HTTP call fails permanently. When a failure happens it is possible that a `start` event won’t have a corresponding `end` event.
+
+![Events Diagram](images/events_with_failures@2x.png)
+
+### Events with Retries and Follow-Ups
+
+OkHttp is resilient and can automatically recover from some connectivity failures. In this case, the `connectFailed()` event is not terminal and not followed by `callFailed()`. Event listeners will receive multiple events of the same type when retries are attempted.
+
+A single HTTP call may require follow-up requests to be made to handle authentication challenges, redirects, and HTTP-layer timeouts. In such cases multiple connections, requests, and responses may be attempted. Follow-ups are another reason a single call may trigger multiple events of the same type.
+
+![Events Diagram](images/events_with_failures_and_retries@2x.png)
+
+### Availability
+
+Events is available as a public API in OkHttp 3.11. Future releases may introduce new event types; you will need to override the corresponding methods to handle them.

+HTTPS
+=====
+
+OkHttp attempts to balance two competing concerns:
+
+ * **Connectivity** to as many hosts as possible. That includes advanced hosts that run the latest versions of [boringssl](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) and less out of date hosts running older versions of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).
+ * **Security** of the connection. This includes verification of the remote webserver with certificates and the privacy of data exchanged with strong ciphers.
+
+When negotiating a connection to an HTTPS server, OkHttp needs to know which [TLS versions](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-tls-version/) and [cipher suites](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-cipher-suite/) to offer. A client that wants to maximize connectivity would include obsolete TLS versions and weak-by-design cipher suites. A strict client that wants to maximize security would be limited to only the latest TLS version and strongest cipher suites.
+
+Specific security vs. connectivity decisions are implemented by [ConnectionSpec](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-connection-spec/). OkHttp includes four built-in connection specs:
+
+ * `RESTRICTED_TLS` is a secure configuration, intended to meet stricter compliance requirements.
+ * `MODERN_TLS` is a secure configuration that connects to modern HTTPS servers.
+ * `COMPATIBLE_TLS` is a secure configuration that connects to secure–but not current–HTTPS servers.
+ * `CLEARTEXT` is an insecure configuration that is used for `http://` URLs.
+
+These loosely follow the model set in [Google Cloud Policies](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-policies-concepts). We [track changes](tls_configuration_history.md) to this policy.
+
+By default, OkHttp will attempt a `MODERN_TLS` connection.  However by configuring the client connectionSpecs you can allow a fall back to `COMPATIBLE_TLS` connection if the modern configuration fails.
+
+```java
+OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
+    .connectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(ConnectionSpec.MODERN_TLS, ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS))
+    .build();
+```
+
+The TLS versions and cipher suites in each spec can change with each release. For example, in OkHttp 2.2 we dropped support for SSL 3.0 in response to the [POODLE](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html) attack. And in OkHttp 2.3 we dropped support for [RC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Security). As with your desktop web browser, staying up-to-date with OkHttp is the best way to stay secure.
+
+You can build your own connection spec with a custom set of TLS versions and cipher suites. For example, this configuration is limited to three highly-regarded cipher suites. Its drawback is that it requires Android 5.0+ and a similarly current webserver.
+
+```java
+ConnectionSpec spec = new ConnectionSpec.Builder(ConnectionSpec.MODERN_TLS)
+    .tlsVersions(TlsVersion.TLS_1_2)
+    .cipherSuites(
+          CipherSuite.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
+          CipherSuite.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
+          CipherSuite.TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256)
+    .build();

+
+### Debugging TLS Handshake Failures
+
+The TLS handshake requires clients and servers to share a common TLS version and cipher suite. This
+depends on the JVM or Android version, OkHttp version, and web server configuration. If there is no
+common cipher suite and TLS version, your call will fail like this:
+
+```
+Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: SSL handshake aborted: ssl=0x7f2719a89e80:
+    Failure in SSL library, usually a protocol error
+        error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake 
+        failure (external/openssl/ssl/s23_clnt.c:770 0x7f2728a53ea0:0x00000000)
+    at com.android.org.conscrypt.NativeCrypto.SSL_do_handshake(Native Method)
+```
+
+You can check a web server's configuration using [Qualys SSL Labs][qualys]. OkHttp's TLS
+configuration history is [tracked here](tls_configuration_history.md).
+
+Applications expected to be installed on older Android devices should consider adopting the
+[Google Play Services’ ProviderInstaller][provider_installer]. This will increase security for users
+and increase connectivity with web servers.
+
+### Certificate Pinning ([.kt][CertificatePinningKotlin], [.java][CertificatePinningJava]) 
+
+By default, OkHttp trusts the certificate authorities of the host platform. This strategy maximizes connectivity, but it is subject to certificate authority attacks such as the [2011 DigiNotar attack](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2510951/cybercrime-hacking/hackers-spied-on-300-000-iranians-using-fake-google-certificate.html). It also assumes your HTTPS servers’ certificates are signed by a certificate authority.
+
+Use [CertificatePinner](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-certificate-pinner/) to restrict which certificates and certificate authorities are trusted. Certificate pinning increases security, but limits your server team’s abilities to update their TLS certificates. **Do not use certificate pinning without the blessing of your server’s TLS administrator!**
+
+=== "Kotlin"
+    ```kotlin
+      private val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
+          .certificatePinner(
+              CertificatePinner.Builder()
+                  .add("publicobject.com", "sha256/afwiKY3RxoMmLkuRW1l7QsPZTJPwDS2pdDROQjXw8ig=")
+                  .build())
+          .build()

+      fun run() {
+        val request = Request.Builder()
+            .url("https://publicobject.com/robots.txt")
+            .build()
+    
+        client.newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
+          if (!response.isSuccessful) throw IOException("Unexpected code $response")
+    
+          for (certificate in response.handshake!!.peerCertificates) {
+            println(CertificatePinner.pin(certificate))
+          }
+        }
+      }
+    ```

+Interceptors
+============
+
+Interceptors are a powerful mechanism that can monitor, rewrite, and retry calls. Here's a simple interceptor that logs the outgoing request and the incoming response.
+
+```java
+class LoggingInterceptor implements Interceptor {
+  @Override public Response intercept(Interceptor.Chain chain) throws IOException {
+    Request request = chain.request();
+
+    long t1 = System.nanoTime();
+    logger.info(String.format("Sending request %s on %s%n%s",
+        request.url(), chain.connection(), request.headers()));
+
+    Response response = chain.proceed(request);
+
+    long t2 = System.nanoTime();
+    logger.info(String.format("Received response for %s in %.1fms%n%s",
+        response.request().url(), (t2 - t1) / 1e6d, response.headers()));
+
+    return response;
+  }
+}
+```
+
+A call to `chain.proceed(request)` is a critical part of each interceptor’s implementation. This simple-looking method is where all the HTTP work happens, producing a response to satisfy the request. If `chain.proceed(request)` is being called more than once previous response bodies must be closed.
+
+Interceptors can be chained. Suppose you have both a compressing interceptor and a checksumming interceptor: you'll need to decide whether data is compressed and then checksummed, or checksummed and then compressed. OkHttp uses lists to track interceptors, and interceptors are called in order.
+
+![Interceptors Diagram](images/interceptors@2x.png)
+
+### Application Interceptors
+
+Interceptors are registered as either _application_ or _network_ interceptors. We'll use the `LoggingInterceptor` defined above to show the difference.
+
+Register an _application_ interceptor by calling `addInterceptor()` on `OkHttpClient.Builder`:
+
+```java
+OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
+    .addInterceptor(new LoggingInterceptor())
+    .build();
+
+Request request = new Request.Builder()
+    .url("http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
+    .header("User-Agent", "OkHttp Example")
+    .build();
+
+Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
+response.body().close();
+```
+
+The URL `http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt` redirects to `https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt`, and OkHttp follows this redirect automatically. Our application interceptor is called **once** and the response returned from `chain.proceed()` has the redirected response:
+
+```
+INFO: Sending request http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt on null
+User-Agent: OkHttp Example
+
+INFO: Received response for https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt in 1179.7ms
+Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
+Content-Type: text/plain
+Content-Length: 1759
+Connection: keep-alive
+```
+
+We can see that we were redirected because `response.request().url()` is different from `request.url()`. The two log statements log two different URLs.
+
+### Network Interceptors
+
+Registering a network interceptor is quite similar. Call `addNetworkInterceptor()` instead of `addInterceptor()`:
+
+```java
+OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
+    .addNetworkInterceptor(new LoggingInterceptor())
+    .build();
+
+Request request = new Request.Builder()
+    .url("http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
+    .header("User-Agent", "OkHttp Example")
+    .build();
+
+Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
+response.body().close();
+```
+
+When we run this code, the interceptor runs twice. Once for the initial request to `http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt`, and another for the redirect to `https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt`.
+
+```
+INFO: Sending request http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt on Connection{www.publicobject.com:80, proxy=DIRECT hostAddress=54.187.32.157 cipherSuite=none protocol=http/1.1}
+User-Agent: OkHttp Example
+Host: www.publicobject.com
+Connection: Keep-Alive
+Accept-Encoding: gzip
+
+INFO: Received response for http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt in 115.6ms
+Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
+Content-Type: text/html
+Content-Length: 193
+Connection: keep-alive
+Location: https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt
+
+INFO: Sending request https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt on Connection{publicobject.com:443, proxy=DIRECT hostAddress=54.187.32.157 cipherSuite=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA protocol=http/1.1}
+User-Agent: OkHttp Example
+Host: publicobject.com
+Connection: Keep-Alive
+Accept-Encoding: gzip
+
+INFO: Received response for https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt in 80.9ms
+Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
+Content-Type: text/plain
+Content-Length: 1759
+Connection: keep-alive
+```
+
+The network requests also contain more data, such as the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header added by OkHttp to advertise support for response compression. The network interceptor's `Chain` has a non-null `Connection` that can be used to interrogate the IP address and TLS configuration that were used to connect to the webserver.
+
+### Choosing between application and network interceptors
+
+Each interceptor chain has relative merits.
+
+**Application interceptors**
+
+ * Don't need to worry about intermediate responses like redirects and retries.
+ * Are always invoked once, even if the HTTP response is served from the cache.
+ * Observe the application's original intent. Unconcerned with OkHttp-injected headers like `If-None-Match`.
+ * Permitted to short-circuit and not call `Chain.proceed()`.
+ * Permitted to retry and make multiple calls to `Chain.proceed()`.
+ * Can adjust Call timeouts using withConnectTimeout, withReadTimeout, withWriteTimeout.
+
+**Network Interceptors**
+
+ * Able to operate on intermediate responses like redirects and retries.
+ * Not invoked for cached responses that short-circuit the network.
+ * Observe the data just as it will be transmitted over the network.
+ * Access to the `Connection` that carries the request.
+
+### Rewriting Requests
+
+Interceptors can add, remove, or replace request headers. They can also transform the body of those requests that have one. For example, you can use an application interceptor to add request body compression if you're connecting to a webserver known to support it.
+
+```java
+/** This interceptor compresses the HTTP request body. Many webservers can't handle this! */
+final class GzipRequestInterceptor implements Interceptor {
+  @Override public Response intercept(Interceptor.Chain chain) throws IOException {
+    Request originalRequest = chain.request();
+    if (originalRequest.body() == null || originalRequest.header("Content-Encoding") != null) {
+      return chain.proceed(originalRequest);
+    }
+
+    Request compressedRequest = originalRequest.newBuilder()
+        .header("Content-Encoding", "gzip")
+        .method(originalRequest.method(), gzip(originalRequest.body()))
+        .build();
+    return chain.proceed(compressedRequest);
+  }
+
+  private RequestBody gzip(final RequestBody body) {
+    return new RequestBody() {
+      @Override public MediaType contentType() {
+        return body.contentType();
+      }
+
+      @Override public long contentLength() {
+        return -1; // We don't know the compressed length in advance!
+      }
+
+      @Override public void writeTo(BufferedSink sink) throws IOException {
+        BufferedSink gzipSink = Okio.buffer(new GzipSink(sink));
+        body.writeTo(gzipSink);
+        gzipSink.close();
+      }
+    };
+  }
+}
+```
+
+### Rewriting Responses
+
+Symmetrically, interceptors can rewrite response headers and transform the response body. This is generally more dangerous than rewriting request headers because it may violate the webserver's expectations!
+
+If you're in a tricky situation and prepared to deal with the consequences, rewriting response headers is a powerful way to work around problems. For example, you can fix a server's misconfigured `Cache-Control` response header to enable better response caching:
+
+```java
+/** Dangerous interceptor that rewrites the server's cache-control header. */
+private static final Interceptor REWRITE_CACHE_CONTROL_INTERCEPTOR = new Interceptor() {
+  @Override public Response intercept(Interceptor.Chain chain) throws IOException {
+    Response originalResponse = chain.proceed(chain.request());
+    return originalResponse.newBuilder()
+        .header("Cache-Control", "max-age=60")
+        .build();
+  }
+};
+```
+
+Typically this approach works best when it complements a corresponding fix on the webserver!

 The `string()` method on response body is convenient and efficient for small documents. But if the response body is large (greater than 1 MiB), avoid `string()` because it will load the entire document into memory. In that case, prefer to process the body as a stream.

 ### Posting a String ([.kt][PostStringKotlin], [.java][PostStringJava])
 
 Use an HTTP POST to send a request body to a service. This example posts a markdown document to a web service that renders markdown as HTML. Because the entire request body is in memory simultaneously, avoid posting large (greater than 1 MiB) documents using this API.

 ### Post Streaming ([.kt][PostStreamingKotlin], [.java][PostStreamingJava])
  
 Here we `POST` a request body as a stream. The content of this request body is being generated as it's being written. This example streams directly into the [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio) buffered sink. Your programs may prefer an `OutputStream`, which you can get from `BufferedSink.outputStream()`.

 ### Posting a multipart request ([.kt][PostMultipartKotlin], [.java][PostMultipartJava])
 
 `MultipartBody.Builder` can build sophisticated request bodies compatible with HTML file upload forms. Each part of a multipart request body is itself a request body, and can define its own headers. If present, these headers should describe the part body, such as its `Content-Disposition`. The `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers are added automatically if they're available.

 Response caching uses HTTP headers for all configuration. You can add request headers like `Cache-Control: max-stale=3600` and OkHttp's cache will honor them. Your webserver configures how long responses are cached with its own response headers, like `Cache-Control: max-age=9600`. There are cache headers to force a cached response, force a network response, or force the network response to be validated with a conditional GET.

+To prevent a response from using the cache, use [`CacheControl.FORCE_NETWORK`](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-cache-control/-f-o-r-c-e_-n-e-t-w-o-r-k/). To prevent it from using the network, use [`CacheControl.FORCE_CACHE`](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-cache-control/-f-o-r-c-e_-c-a-c-h-e/). Be warned: if you use `FORCE_CACHE` and the response requires the network, OkHttp will return a `504 Unsatisfiable Request` response.
  
 ### Canceling a Call ([.kt][CancelCallKotlin], [.java][CancelCallJava])
 
 Use `Call.cancel()` to stop an ongoing call immediately. If a thread is currently writing a request or reading a response, it will receive an `IOException`. Use this to conserve the network when a call is no longer necessary; for example when your user navigates away from an application. Both synchronous and asynchronous calls can be canceled.

 ### Timeouts ([.kt][ConfigureTimeoutsKotlin], [.java][ConfigureTimeoutsJava])
 
 Use timeouts to fail a call when its peer is unreachable. Network partitions can be due to client connectivity problems, server availability problems, or anything between. OkHttp supports connect, write, read, and full call timeouts.

 ### Per-call Configuration ([.kt][PerCallSettingsKotlin], [.java][PerCallSettingsJava])
 
 All the HTTP client configuration lives in `OkHttpClient` including proxy settings, timeouts, and caches. When you need to change the configuration of a single call, call `OkHttpClient.newBuilder()`. This returns a builder that shares the same connection pool, dispatcher, and configuration with the original client. In the example below, we make one request with a 500 ms timeout and another with a 3000 ms timeout.

-    To avoid making many retries when authentication isn't working, you can return null to give up. For example, you may want to skip the retry when these exact credentials have already been attempted:
-    
-    ```java
-      if (credential.equals(response.request().header("Authorization"))) {
-        return null; // If we already failed with these credentials, don't retry.
-       }
-    ```
-    
-    You may also skip the retry when you’ve hit an application-defined attempt limit:
-    
-    ```java
-      if (responseCount(response) >= 3) {
-        return null; // If we've failed 3 times, give up.
-      }
-    ```
-    
-    This above code relies on this `responseCount()` method:
-    
-    ```java
-      private int responseCount(Response response) {
-        int result = 1;
-        while ((response = response.priorResponse()) != null) {

+          System.out.println("Authenticating for response: " + response);
+          System.out.println("Challenges: " + response.challenges());
+          String credential = Credentials.basic("jesse", "password1");
+          return response.request().newBuilder()
+              .header("Authorization", credential)
+              .build();
         }
-        return result;
-      }
-    ```
+      })
+      .build();
+}
+
+public void run() throws Exception {
+  Request request = new Request.Builder()
+      .url("http://publicobject.com/secrets/hellosecret.txt")
+      .build();
+
+  try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
+    if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);
+
+    System.out.println(response.body().string());
+  }
+}
+```
+    
+  To avoid making many retries when authentication isn't working, you can return null to give up. For example, you may want to skip the retry when these exact credentials have already been attempted:
+
+```java
+if (credential.equals(response.request().header("Authorization"))) {
+  return null; // If we already failed with these credentials, don't retry.
+ }
+```
+
+  You may also skip the retry when you’ve hit an application-defined attempt limit:
+
+```java
+if (responseCount(response) >= 3) {
+  return null; // If we've failed 3 times, give up.
+}
+```
+
+  This above code relies on this `responseCount()` method:
+
+```java
+private int responseCount(Response response) {
+  int result = 1;
+  while ((response = response.priorResponse()) != null) {
+    result++;
+  }
+  return result;
+}
+```

+Upgrading to OkHttp 4
+=====================
+
+OkHttp 4.x upgrades our implementation language from Java to Kotlin and keeps everything else the
+same. We’ve chosen Kotlin because it gives us powerful new capabilities while integrating closely
+with Java.
+
+We spent a lot of time and energy on retaining strict compatibility with OkHttp 3.x. We’re even
+keeping the package name the same: `okhttp3`!
+
+There are three kinds of compatibility we’re tracking:
+
+ * **Binary compatibility** is the ability to compile a program against OkHttp 3.x, and then to run
+   it against OkHttp 4.x. We’re using the excellent [japicmp][japicmp] library via its
+   [Gradle plugin][japicmp_gradle] to enforce binary compatibility.
+
+ * **Java source compatibility** is the ability to upgrade Java uses of OkHttp 3.x to 4.x without
+   changing `.java` files.
+
+ * **Kotlin source compatibility** is the ability to upgrade Kotlin uses of OkHttp 3.x to 4.x
+   without changing `.kt` files.
+
+With a few small exceptions (below), OkHttp 4.x is both binary- and Java source-compatible with
+OkHttp 3.x. You can use an OkHttp 4.x .jar file with applications or libraries built for OkHttp 3.x.
+
+OkHttp is **not** source-compatible for Kotlin callers, but upgrading should be automatic thanks to
+Kotlin’s powerful deprecation features. Most developers should be able to use IntelliJ’s _Code
+Cleanup_ for a safe and fast upgrade.
+
+
+Backwards-Incompatible Changes
+------------------------------
+
+#### OkHttpClient final methods
+
+`OkHttpClient` has 26 accessors like `interceptors()` and `writeTimeoutMillis()` that were non-final
+in OkHttp 3.x and are final in 4.x. These were made non-final for use with mocking frameworks like
+[Mockito][mockito]. We believe subtyping `OkHttpClient` is the wrong way to test with OkHttp. If
+you must, mock `Call.Factory` which is the interface that `OkHttpClient` implements.
+
+#### Internal API changes
+
+The `okhttp3.internal` package is not a published API and we change it frequently without warning.
+Depending on code in this package is bad and will cause you problems with any upgrade! But the 4.x
+will be particularly painful to naughty developers that import from this package! We changed a lot
+to take advantage of sweet Kotlin features.
+
+#### Credentials.basic()
+
+The username and password parameters to `Credentials.basic()` are now non-null strings. In OkHttp
+3.x, null would yield a username or password of "null".
+
+#### HttpUrl.queryParameterValues()
+
+The return type of `HttpUrl.queryParameterValues()` is `List<String?>`. Lists that may contain null
+are uncommon and Kotlin callers may have incorrectly assigned the result to `List<String>`.
+
+
+Code Cleanup
+------------
+
+IntelliJ and Android Studio offer a **Code Cleanup** feature that will automatically update
+deprecated APIs with their replacements. Access this feature from the _Search Anywhere_ dialog
+(double-press shift) or under the _Analyze_ menu.
+
+We’ve included deprecated APIs in OkHttp 4.0 because they make migration easy. We will remove them
+in a future release! If you’re skipping releases, it’ll be much easier if you upgrade to OkHttp 4.0
+as an intermediate step.
+
+#### Vars and Vals
+
+Java doesn’t have language support for properties so developers make do with getters and setters.
+Kotlin does have properties and we take advantage of them in OkHttp.
+
+ * **Address**: certificatePinner, connectionSpecs, dns, hostnameVerifier, protocols, proxy,
+   proxyAuthenticator, proxySelector, socketFactory, sslSocketFactory, url
+ * **Cache**: directory
+ * **CacheControl**: immutable, maxAgeSeconds, maxStaleSeconds, minFreshSeconds, mustRevalidate,
+   noCache, noStore, noTransform, onlyIfCached, sMaxAgeSeconds
+ * **Challenge**: authParams, charset, realm, scheme
+ * **CipherSuite**: javaName
+ * **ConnectionSpec**: cipherSuites, supportsTlsExtensions, tlsVersions
+ * **Cookie**: domain, expiresAt, hostOnly, httpOnly, name, path, persistent, value
+ * **Dispatcher**: executorService
+ * **FormBody**: size
+ * **Handshake**: cipherSuite, localCertificates, localPrincipal, peerCertificates, peerPrincipal,
+   tlsVersion
+ * **HandshakeCertificates**: keyManager, trustManager
+ * **Headers**: size
+ * **HeldCertificate**: certificate, keyPair
+ * **HttpLoggingInterceptor**: level
+ * **HttpUrl**: encodedFragment, encodedPassword, encodedPath, encodedPathSegments, encodedQuery,
+   encodedUsername, fragment, host, password, pathSegments, pathSize, port, query,
+   queryParameterNames, querySize, scheme, username
+ * **MockResponse**: headers, http2ErrorCode, socketPolicy, status, trailers
+ * **MockWebServer**: bodyLimit, port, protocolNegotiationEnabled, protocols, requestCount,
+   serverSocketFactory
+ * **MultipartBody.Part**: body, headers
+ * **MultipartBody.**: boundary, parts, size, type
+ * **OkHttpClient**: authenticator, cache, callTimeoutMillis, certificatePinner,
+   connectTimeoutMillis, connectionPool, connectionSpecs, cookieJar, dispatcher, dns,
+   eventListenerFactory, followRedirects, followSslRedirects, hostnameVerifier, interceptors,
+   networkInterceptors, pingIntervalMillis, protocols, proxy, proxyAuthenticator, proxySelector,
+   readTimeoutMillis, retryOnConnectionFailure, socketFactory, sslSocketFactory, writeTimeoutMillis
+ * **PushPromise**: headers, method, path, response
+ * **Request**: body, cacheControl, headers, method, url
+ * **Response**: body, cacheControl, cacheResponse, code, handshake, headers, message,
+   networkResponse, priorResponse, protocol, receivedResponseAtMillis, request, sentRequestAtMillis
+ * **Route**: address, proxy, socketAddress
+ * **TlsVersion**: javaName
+
+#### Renamed Functions
+
+* **Headers.of()**: for symmetry with `listOf()`, `setOf()`, etc., we’ve replaced
+  `Headers.of(String...)` with `headersOf(vararg String)`.
+
+#### Extension Functions
+
+We’ve migrated from static functions to extension functions where we think they fit.

+SAM Conversions
+---------------
+
+When you use Java APIs from Kotlin you can operate on Java interfaces as if they were Kotlin
+lambdas. The [feature][java_sams] is available for interfaces that define a Single Abstract Method
+(SAM).
+
+But when you use Kotlin APIs from Kotlin there’s no automatic conversion. Code that used SAM lambdas
+with OkHttp 3.x: must use `object :` with OkHttp 4.x:
+
+Kotlin calling OkHttp 3.x:
+
+```kotlin
+val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
+    .dns { hostname -> InetAddress.getAllByName(hostname).toList() }
+    .build()
+```
+
+Kotlin calling OkHttp 4.x:
+
+```kotlin
+val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
+    .dns(object : Dns {
+      override fun lookup(hostname: String) =
+          InetAddress.getAllByName(hostname).toList()
+    })
+    .build()
+```
+
+SAM conversion impacts these APIs:
+
+ * Authenticator
+ * Dispatcher.setIdleCallback(Runnable)
+ * Dns
+ * EventListener.Factory
+ * HttpLoggingInterceptor.Logger
+ * LoggingEventListener.Factory
+ * OkHttpClient.Builder.hostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier)
+
+JetBrains [is working on][kotlin_sams] SAM conversions of Kotlin interfaces. Expect it in a future
+release of the Kotlin language.
+
+
+Companion Imports
+-----------------
+
+The equivalent of static methods in Java is companion object functions in Kotlin. The bytecode is
+the same but `.kt` files now need `Companion` in the import.
+
+This works with OkHttp 3.x:
+
+```kotlin
+import okhttp3.CipherSuite.forJavaName
+```
+
+But OkHttp 4.x needs a `Companion`:
+
+```kotlin
+import okhttp3.CipherSuite.Companion.forJavaName
+```
+
+In the unlikely event that you have a lot of these, run this:
+
+```bash
+sed -i "" \
+  's/^\(import okhttp3\.[^.]*\)\.\([a-z][a-zA-Z]*\)$/\1.Companion.\2/g' \
+  `find . -name "*.kt"`
+```
+
+
+Advanced Profiling
+------------------
+
+Android Studio’s Advanced Profiling feature rewrites OkHttp bytecode for instrumentation.
+Unfortunately it crashes on OkHttp 4.x’s bytecode. Until [Google’s bug][advanced_profiling_bug] is
+fixed you must disable advanced profiling in Android Studio.
+
+![Disable Advanced Profiling](images/disable_advanced_profiling@2x.png)
+
+
+R8 / ProGuard
+-------------
+
+R8 and ProGuard are both code optimizers for `.class` files.
+
+R8 is the [default optimizer][r8] in Android Studio 3.4 and newer. It works well with all
+releases of OkHttp.
+
+ProGuard was the previous default. We’re [tracking problems][proguard_problems] with interactions
+between ProGuard, OkHttp 4.x, and Kotlin-originated `.class` files. Make sure you’re on the latest
+release if you’re using ProGuard,
+
+
+Gradle
+------
+
+OkHttp 4’s minimum requirements are Java 8+ and Android 5+. These requirements were
+[first introduced][require_android_5] with OkHttp 3.13.
+
+Here’s what you need in `build.gradle` to target Java 8 byte code for Kotlin, Java, and Android
+plugins respectively.
+
+```groovy
+compileKotlin {
+  kotlinOptions {
+    jvmTarget = "1.8"
+  }
+}
+compileTestKotlin {
+  kotlinOptions {
+    jvmTarget = "1.8"
+  }
+}
+
+compileJava {
+  sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
+  targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
+}
+
+android {
+  compileOptions {
+    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
+    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
+  }
+}
+```
