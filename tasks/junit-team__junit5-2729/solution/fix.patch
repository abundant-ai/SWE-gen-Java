+* `StringUtils.nullSafeToString()` now returns `"null"` if the invocation of `toString()`
+  on the supplied object returns `null`. Although this is an internal utility, the effect
+  of this change may be witnessed by end users and test engine or extension authors.
+* Method `scanForClassesInPackage(String)` in `ClasspathScanner` now returns a valid list

+
+==== Bug Fixes
+
+* If the `toString()` implementation of an argument passed to a `@ParameterizedTest`
+  method returns `null`, the display name formatter for the parameterized test now treats
+  the name of the corresponding argument as `"null"` instead of throwing an exception.
+  This fixes a regression introduced in JUnit Jupiter 5.7.0.
+* Creator functions passed to `ExtensionContext.Store.getOrComputeIfAbsent()` are now only
+  called once even if they throw an exception.
+
+==== New Features and Improvements
+
+* The user guide now explains Nested Tests in more detail.
+* New utility method in `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` helps to ensure all test
+  instances are processed when used in conjunction with `@Nested` tests.

+[[release-notes-5.8.0-overall-improvements]]
+=== Overall Improvements
+
+==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
+
+* Since the API Guardian dependency is no longer exported as a runtime but rather as a
+  compile-only dependency to consuming Gradle projects, Gradle builds that define their own
+  https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations[dependency configurations]
+  may be affected. For example, if the custom configuration is used to manipulate a source
+  set's classpath directly, dependency attributes needed for Gradle's variant-aware
+  dependency management are dropped, and API Guardian is missing from the compile
+  classpath. In that case, the Java compiler emits warnings which -- depending on your
+  configured options -- may cause the build to fail. The solution is to avoid manipulating
+  a source set's classpath directly. Instead, its dependency configurations should extend
+  from your custom configuration. An example of such a change can be seen in
+  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/d23afea168b8360d08bf296ac2189239ab9db7fc[this commit]
+  to the Spring Framework repository.
+
+==== New Features and Improvements
+
+* The API Guardian dependency is now exported as a compile-only dependency for consuming
+  Gradle projects and no longer required at runtime when running on the module path.
+* Logging messages are no longer issued at `INFO` level in order to lower the "textual
+  noise" on the console when Java's Util Logging is used in its default configuration.
+
+
+[[release-notes-5.8.0-junit-platform]]
+=== JUnit Platform
+
+==== Bug Fixes
+
+* Classes explicitly selected via `@SelectClasses` are now always included in the test
+  suite. This applies to `@Suite` classes running via the `SuiteTestEngine` and suite
+  classes running via the `JUnitPlatform` `Runner`.
+* `SummaryGeneratingListener` is now thread-safe and can handle concurrently failing tests.
+
+==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
+
+* The `JUnitPlatform` runner has been deprecated in favor of the new `@Suite` support. See
+  the warning in <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-junit-platform-runner, Using
+  JUnit 4 to run the JUnit Platform>> for details.
+* For consistency with the rest of the JUnit Platform, the experimental
+  `LauncherDiscoveryListener` is now an interface instead of an abstract class.
+
+==== New Features and Improvements
+
+* New `junit-platform-suite-engine` module to execute declarative test suites on the JUnit
+  Platform. See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#junit-platform-suite-engine, JUnit Platform
+  Suite Engine>> for details.
+* Additional selectors in the suite API in the `junit-platform-suite-api` module. See the
+  Javadoc of the `{suite-api-package}` package for a full list of supported annotations
+  and further details.
+* New `UniqueIdTrackingListener` which is a `TestExecutionListener` that tracks the unique
+  IDs of all tests that were skipped or executed during the `TestPlan` and generates a
+  file containing the unique IDs. The generated file can be used to rerun those tests --
+  for example, in order to run the same set of tests executed on the JVM subsequently
+  within a GraalVM native image. See the Javadoc for `{UniqueIdTrackingListener}` for
+  details.
+* New `findAnnotation(Class,Class,SearchOption)` method in `AnnotationSupport` that
+  performs the same search algorithm as `findAnnotation(AnnotatedElement,Class)` but also
+  searches the enclosing class hierarchy for inner classes if the
+  `INCLUDE_ENCLOSING_CLASSES` `SearchOption` is specified. This new method can be used by
+  extension authors to find annotations on enclosing classes for JUnit Jupiter `@Nested`
+  test classes.
+* New `test(Condition<Event>)` and `nestedContainer(Class<?>, Condition<Event>)` methods
+  in `EventConditions` that allow you to provide conditions for matching against test and
+  nested container events when using the `EngineTestKit`. For example,
+  `test(displayName("my test"))` can be used to match against a test whose display name is
+  `my test`.
+* Generating Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events via the `junit-platform-jfr` module is now
+  also supported on Java 8 Update 262 or higher, in addition to Java 11 or later. See
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-listeners-flight-recorder, Flight Recorder
+  Support>> for details.
+* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now publishes execution events for containers -- for
+  example, test classes.
+* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now publishes test discovery events for the launcher and
+  registered test engines.
+* New `ClassSource.from(URI)` static factory method for creating a `ClassSource` from a
+  URI using the `class` scheme and optional query parameters specifying the line number
+  and column number. This is analogous to the existing `ClasspathResourceSource.from(URI)`
+  factory method.
+* New `getConfigurationParameters()` method in the `TestPlan` which allows a
+  `TestExecutionListener` to access
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-config-params, configuration parameters>>. See
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-listeners-config, Configuring an Execution
+  Listener>> for details.
+* Custom `LauncherDiscoveryListener` implementations can now be registered via Java’s
+  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
+* Documented constant value of `ExclusiveResource.GLOBAL_KEY`.
+* Instances of `TestIdentifier` and `UniqueId` now retain less memory because they no
+  longer store `String` representations of unique IDs.
+* Tools that make multiple calls to the `Launcher` API should now create a
+  `LauncherSession` in order to allow for executing global setup and teardown code exactly
+  once via the new `LauncherSessionListener` interface that can be registered via Java’s
+  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
+
+
+[[release-notes-5.8.0-junit-jupiter]]
+=== JUnit Jupiter
+
+==== Bug Fixes
+
+* `@DisplayNameGeneration` and `@IndicativeSentencesGeneration` are now only inherited
+  from enclosing classes if the current class is a `@Nested` test class.
+* The `IndicativeSentences` `DisplayNameGenerator` no longer includes the display name of
+  the enclosing class when generating an _indicative sentence_ if the enclosing class is
+  not configured to use the `IndicativeSentences` display name generator as well.
+* The `TypedArgumentConverter` base class now supports the conversion of a `null` source
+  value in parameterized tests.
+* The `TypedArgumentConverter` base class now supports conversion to a primitive type if
+  the configured target type is a wrapper for the target primitive type, including
+  primitive widening support -- for example, from `Integer` to `int` or `long`.
+* Exceptions thrown from instances of `CloseableResource` no longer hide test failures but
+  are instead reported as suppressed exceptions.
+
+==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
+
+* The new `autoCloseArguments` feature in `@ParameterizedTest` may potentially be a
+  breaking change for existing parameterized test methods if an argument that implements
+  `java.lang.AutoCloseable` is reused for multiple invocations of the same parameterized
+  test method. If your parameterized test methods start to fail when you upgrade to JUnit
+  Jupiter 5.8, you can disable this feature by declaring
+  `@ParameterizedTest(autoCloseArguments = false)`.
+* `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, ExtensionContext)` has
+  been deprecated in favor of
+  `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, DynamicTestInvocationContext, ExtensionContext)`
+  that provides access to the dynamic test executable via
+  `DynamicTestInvocationContext.getExecutable()`.
+
+==== New Features and Improvements
+
+* Test classes can now be ordered _globally_ by supplying the fully-qualified name of a
+  class implementing the `ClassOrderer` API as the value of the new
+  `junit.jupiter.testclass.order.default` configuration parameter. See
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-test-execution-order-classes, Class Order>> for
+  details.
+* `@Nested` test classes can be ordered _locally_ via the new `@TestClassOrder` annotation
+  in which a `ClassOrderer` can be specified.
+* `@ExtendWith` may now be used to register extensions declaratively via fields or
+  parameters in test class constructors, test methods, and lifecycle methods. See
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-declarative, Declarative Extension
+  Registration>> for details.
+* `@RegisterExtension` fields may now be `private`.
+* New `assertThrowsExactly()` method in `Assertions` which is a more strict version of
+  `assertThrows()` that allows you to assert that the exception thrown is of the exact
+  type specified.
+* `assertDoesNotThrow()` in `Assertions` now supports suspending functions when called
+  from Kotlin.
+* New `assertInstanceOf()` methods which produce better error messages comparable to those
+  produced by `assertThrows`. These new methods serve as a replacement for
+  `assertTrue(obj instanceof X)`.
+* `assertNull()` failure messages now include the actual object's type if the `toString()`
+  implementation for the actual object returns `null` or `"null"`. This avoids the
+  generation of confusing failure messages such as `expected <null> but was <null>`.
+* `@TempDir` can now be used to create multiple temporary directories. Instead of creating
+  a single temporary directory per context (i.e. test class or method) every declaration
+  of the `@TempDir` annotation on a field or method parameter now results in a separate
+  temporary directory. To revert to the old behavior of using a single temporary directory
+  for the entire test class or method (depending on which level the annotation is used),
+  you can set the `junit.jupiter.tempdir.scope` configuration parameter to `per_context`.
+* `@TempDir` cleanup resets readable and executable permissions of the root temporary
+  directory and any contained directories instead of failing to delete them.
+* `@TempDir` fields may now be `private`.
+* `DynamicTests.stream()` can now consume `Named` input and will use each name-value pair
+  as the display name and value for each generated dynamic test (see
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-dynamic-tests-examples,User Guide>> for details).
+* New `class` URI scheme for dynamic test sources. This allows tests to be located using
+  the information available in a `StackTraceElement`.
+* Dynamic tests now require less memory thanks to a number of improvements to internal
+  data structures.
+* New `autoCloseArguments` attribute in `@ParameterizedTest` to close
+  `java.lang.AutoCloseable` arguments after each invocation of the parameterized test
+  method. This attribute defaults to `true`.
+* Numeric literals used with `@CsvSource` or `CsvFileSource` can now be expressed using
+  underscores as in some JVM languages, to improve readability of long numbers like
+  `700_000_000`.
+* CSV rows provided via `@CsvSource` may now start with a number sign (`#`).
+* New `ignoreLeadingAndTrailingWhitespace` attributes in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`
+  (set to `true` by default) to control whether or not to trim whitespace.
+* In parameterized tests using `@MethodSource` or `@ArgumentSource`, arguments can now have
+  optional names (supplied via the new `Named` API). When the argument is included in the
+  display name of an invocation, this name will be used instead of the value.
+* Documented constant values in `org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Resources`.
+
+
+[[release-notes-5.8.0-junit-vintage]]
+=== JUnit Vintage
+
+==== Bug Fixes
+
+* If multiple exceptions are registered as failures for a JUnit 4 based test -- for
+  example, if the `ErrorCollector` rule throws an
+  `org.junit.runners.model.MultipleFailureException` -- all of those failures are now
+  added as _suppressed exceptions_ in the `org.opentest4j.MultipleFailuresError` created
+  by the `VintageTestEngine`. This allows users to analyze the stack trace of each failure
+  when such a test fails.
+
+==== New Features and Improvements
+
+* The JUnit Vintage engine now requires less memory and allows for earlier garbage
+  collection thanks to a number of improvements to internal data structures.
