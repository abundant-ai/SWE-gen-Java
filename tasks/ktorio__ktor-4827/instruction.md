The `io.ktor.http.Url` class does not correctly handle `data:` URLs. When constructing a `Url` from a valid data URL string, the resulting `Url` representation is mangled: converting it back to a string (for example via `url.toString()` or string interpolation `"$url"`) does not preserve the original input, and components may be incorrectly parsed as if the URL were hierarchical (e.g., as if it had an authority/host/path structure).

Update `Url` parsing and rendering so that `data:` URLs are supported as first-class URLs. In particular, when `Url` is created from a string starting with the `data` scheme (e.g., `"data:text/plain,Hello"`, `"data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8="`, or other valid media type/parameter forms), the URL must round-trip without modification: `Url(original).toString()` must equal the original string (byte-for-byte, including commas/semicolons and any base64 marker).

The implementation should not attempt to interpret `data:` URLs using host/port/userinfo semantics (they have no authority section), and it must not introduce or remove slashes, escape/normalize the payload, or drop/reshape the media type and parameters portion. Accessing common `Url` properties for such URLs should not throw, and protocol/scheme detection should report `data` as the protocol name.
