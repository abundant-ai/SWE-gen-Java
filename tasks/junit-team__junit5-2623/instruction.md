Suite-based discovery does not honor the configuration parameters from the parent discovery request that discovered the suite. When a suite is executed, the suite engine creates a new discovery request and ends up using implicit configuration parameters (for example, system properties) while ignoring explicit configuration parameters supplied via the parent discovery request. This leads to surprising behavior: running a suite with explicit configuration (such as values provided through a launcher/console configuration mechanism) does not affect test discovery/execution inside the suite, but implicit parameters (like -D system properties) can.

The suite discovery behavior must be changed so that when a suite is discovered/executed, the discovery of tests inside the suite uses (1) configuration parameters explicitly declared for the suite itself and (2) the configuration parameters from the parent discovery request used to discover the suite. In other words, suite discovery should inherit the parent discovery request’s configuration parameters instead of always rebuilding configuration from implicit sources.

Additionally, there must be a way to disable inheriting parent configuration parameters for suites. Introduce support for a suite-level annotation named org.junit.platform.suite.api.DisableParentConfigurationParameters. When this annotation is present on a @Suite class, discovery within that suite must not inherit any configuration parameters from the parent discovery request; only the suite’s explicitly provided configuration parameters (for example via suite annotations such as @ConfigurationParameter) should be used.

As a consequence of the above, a suite should never automatically use implicit configuration parameters unless the parent discovery request already included them. This is important for use cases like running packaged test suites (e.g., TCKs) where imported suites should not be influenced by ambient implicit properties.

Implement the behavior in the suite discovery request building and suite engine discovery flow so that:

- Suites discovered from a Class (e.g., passing a @Suite class) and suites discovered from a UniqueId both discover the same descendants when suite discovery runs.
- Calling SuiteTestDescriptor.discover() performs discovery using the correct configuration parameter set and produces stable discovery results.
- The builder responsible for suite launcher discovery requests (SuiteLauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder.request() and its build process) must incorporate parent ConfigurationParameters by default, and must exclude them when @DisableParentConfigurationParameters is present.
- ConfigurationParameters implementations used by the launcher (LauncherConfigurationParameters) must correctly support explicit values and inherited values with clear precedence so that explicitly provided configuration parameters are visible during suite discovery.

If preconditions are violated (e.g., invalid inputs when building/reading configuration parameters), the same kinds of exceptions currently used in the platform should be thrown (notably PreconditionViolationException for invalid arguments).
