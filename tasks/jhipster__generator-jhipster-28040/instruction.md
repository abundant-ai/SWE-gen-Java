When generating a Spring Boot application configured to use Couchbase, enabling a cache provider should result in the generated sample application actually using Spring’s Cache abstraction during typical REST operations.

Currently, even when a cache provider is enabled for a Couchbase-based generated app, the generated integration tests do not validate caching behavior (or the generated app behaves as if caching is effectively disabled). As a result, cache-related regressions can slip through unnoticed in Couchbase setups.

Update the generated Couchbase sample so that caching is enabled and observable in the user management REST flow. In particular, the generated integration test class `UserResourceIT` should, when any cache provider is enabled, interact with `org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` and verify that relevant caches are created/populated and can be accessed via `CacheManager.getCache(...)`. The generated test should be able to retrieve a non-null `Cache` instance for the expected cache name(s) and validate that cache usage is not a no-op.

This should work for Couchbase without breaking other database types. Couchbase-specific security context handling (using `SecurityContextHolder` / `TestSecurityContextHolder`) must continue to work alongside the caching verification. The end result is that a Couchbase app generated with caching turned on will have caching effectively enabled in the sample and covered by integration tests, rather than silently skipping cache behavior.
