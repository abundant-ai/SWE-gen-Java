Creating JSON adapters repeatedly is currently expensive because each call to `Moshi.adapter(Type)`/`Moshi.adapter(Class<?>)` rebuilds adapter chains even when the same type + annotation set has already been resolved before. Add an in-memory cache so that once Moshi has created a `JsonAdapter` for a given `(Type, Set<? extends Annotation>)` (including the empty set), subsequent calls for the same key return the same adapter instance (or an equivalent cached wrapper) rather than recomputing the adapter.

The cache must work correctly with recursive and self-referential types (where adapter creation can re-enter Moshi while an adapter is still being built). Adapter creation must not deadlock or overflow, and it must still resolve cyclic graphs by using the existing “deferred”/placeholder behavior Moshi uses for recursion. The caching must also respect per-call configuration: if a caller takes a base adapter and calls configuration methods like `lenient()`, `failOnUnknown()`, `serializeNulls()`, or `nullSafe()`, these derived adapters should behave correctly and must not corrupt the cached base adapter’s behavior for other callers.

Additionally, define and enforce a deterministic precedence order when multiple adapter factories could match the same type/annotations. When multiple factories are registered, `Moshi.Builder.add(...)` ordering should produce a clear winner such that adapter resolution is stable and predictable across runs.

Finally, forbid registering adapters with annotation literals when those annotations require members/values. For example, if an annotation type has required elements (no defaults), attempting to register an adapter using an “empty” annotation instance should fail fast rather than silently registering something that can never correctly match. This should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` at registration time with a message explaining that annotation values are required.

Implement helpful `toString()` output for common adapters/factories so that debugging/step-through inspection of adapter graphs is easier; calling `toString()` on adapters produced by Moshi should yield a meaningful description rather than the default object identity string.
