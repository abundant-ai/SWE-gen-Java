Retrofit currently triggers Java compiler–generated synthetic accessor methods in several places due to visibility mismatches between nested/anonymous classes and the members they access. This increases method count and can cause unwanted synthetic methods to appear in stack traces and in bytecode-inspection-based checks.

The problem shows up when Retrofit defines anonymous or nested implementations (for example, anonymous `Converter` implementations returned from `Converter.Factory` methods such as `responseBodyConverter(...)` and `requestBodyConverter(...)`) that need to reference members which are not sufficiently visible. In these cases, javac generates `access$...` synthetic methods to bridge access, which should not be necessary.

Adjust the visibility of the relevant members/classes so that these anonymous/nested implementations can access what they need directly without requiring synthetic accessor methods. In particular, ensure that:

- Returning a `Converter` from `Converter.Factory.responseBodyConverter(Type, Annotation[], Retrofit)` and `Converter.Factory.requestBodyConverter(Type, Annotation[], Retrofit)` can safely reference any required constants or members without causing the compiler to emit synthetic `access$...` methods.
- Any shared constants used by these converters (e.g., a `MediaType` constant used to create a `RequestBody`) have a visibility level that avoids synthetic accessor generation when referenced from nested/anonymous classes.

After the change, compiling Retrofit should no longer produce new synthetic accessor methods related to these converter factory patterns, while behavior remains the same: converting a `ResponseBody` to `String` should return `value.string()`, and converting a `String` to `RequestBody` should create a plain-text body using the expected media type.
