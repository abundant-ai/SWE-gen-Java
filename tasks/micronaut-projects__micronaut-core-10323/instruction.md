When Micronaut’s Netty HTTP server receives an HTTP/1 request body that is encoded with a compression scheme (e.g., gzip/deflate) but the payload is malformed or truncated, Netty’s decompression handlers can throw an exception during request processing. Currently these decompression failures are logged at a high severity (INFO/WARN/ERROR), which can generate significant log spam when a server is exposed to random/hostile traffic (including fuzzing inputs), even though the failure is usually just an invalid client request.

Change the server so that decompression failures are treated as a low-importance diagnostic event: the exception should be logged at DEBUG level (or otherwise not emitted at INFO/WARN/ERROR by default). The server should still handle the failure correctly (i.e., close the connection or reject the request as appropriate), but it should not produce noisy logs at normal log levels.

Additionally, the server must remain robust under a variety of malformed HTTP/1 inputs (including invalid/malformed headers and bodies) such that processing these inputs does not leak Netty buffers (no ByteBuf reference-count leaks) and does not leave channels/resources uncollected after the connection is closed.

Reproduction example: open a raw TCP connection to the HTTP port and send an HTTP/1.1 request that advertises a compressed request body (via Content-Encoding) but contains random bytes or a truncated compressed stream. Expected: request is rejected/connection closed without WARN/ERROR log spam about decompression failure; if DEBUG logging is enabled, a decompression error may be logged. Actual: decompression exception is logged at higher severity causing log spam.
